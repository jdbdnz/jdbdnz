I joined Swayable as it completed Y Combinator 2018 on the idea we'd measure the impact of political advertising on public opinion using randomized controlled experiments.

Swayable grew and scaled, adapting to a broader mission of measuring the persuasiveness of any content. Today Swayable sells a suite of tools to understand brand perception and how messaging affects it.

From 2019-2024 I led product engineering, laying the foundations for all of Web apps and APIs, including a survey tool which has conducted millions of interviews, and a data exploration and visualization suite allowing customers to dynamically explore the results of thousands of ad experiments and gain key insights about their audiences.

I grew to manage a team of five full-stack engineers, discovering natural skills in mentorship, and a great deal of satisfaction in helping grow the skills and careers of other engineers.

I reported directly to Swayable's [CTO Valerie Coffman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/valeriecoffman/) from whom I learned a great deal about data science and distributed computing, and worked closely with the outstanding [Product Designer Iri Hoxha](https://www.linkedin.com/in/irihoxha/).
