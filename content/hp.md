_Not lovelier folk have I worked with that those found in the bullpit of HP's Instant Ink. I spent those idyllic days treated to free breakfasts at the cafeteria, and mid-afternoon doubles tournaments at the ping pong tables. We also shipped Ink, so, so much ink._

_Even the 'real' engineers, those who designed and developed printer components capable of expertly transporting ink and liquid plastics through fine hoses and nozzles, humored we web developers with kindness. Like an adult treating with children, they confused us with the details of their latest patents and exploits._

I was a "web and database engineer" at for HP's product Instant Ink, which provides "Ink-a-service" charging customers monthly and delivering new Ink cartridges as they run low.

Daily, I developed and maintained a Ruby on Rails monolith with charged subscriptions monthly. I also developed a React app for imploring customers to keep their subscriptions if they were to attempt to unsubscribe: _"Are you quite sure you would not like to stay? Not at any price? What if it were free for a limited number of pages?"_. And that is usually what got them, the free for 10 pages deal.

My most significant impact came when our subscriber base hit such a level that we had trouble billing them all on the correct date. I spearheaded the effort to parallelize our subscription billing on AWS with queues and workers, after which all charges happily ticked along as the customer base swelled and swelled.
