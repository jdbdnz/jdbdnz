My superpower is shipping! Since 2013, I’ve been immersed in startups, earning a reputation for finding the
critical path and sprinting it.

I’ve been a founding engineer, prepped for an IPO, and navigated the hairy middle stages of growth.
As a manager, an IC, and often something murky in-between, I’ve learned a lot from both successes and failures.

I’ve also worked for big companies like Hewlett-Packard and, long ago, gained valuable lessons as a founder.

I have deep experience in building scalable, maintainable, and performant web applications using modern
technologies like React, Vue, Node Express, and MongoDB.
I also know a thing or two about Python and machine learning (AI).

When I’m not coding, you’ll find me sailing, spending time with my dogs, or lost in a great sci-fi book.

Welcome to my corner of the web!
