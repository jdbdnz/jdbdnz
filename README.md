Hi 👋 I'm Dezzy, web engineer.

My favorite technologies are Vue.js, Tailwind CSS, MongoDB, and GraphQL. But I also work with React, Python, Rails, Node.js, and SQL.

🧑‍💻 Building startups is my jam! I was a founding product engineer at [Swayable](https://www.swayable.com), joined [Procore](https://www.procore.com) in the lead-up to their IPO, and led engineering at a few startups which "failed fast" earlier in my career doing adult learning, gig economy, and video gaming social. Check out my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jdbdnz/) if you're interested in more career details.

⛵ I live on [the Columbia River](https://maps.app.goo.gl/G2iCaA7iQSxXLXo89) where I love racing sailboats with my local [Island Sailing Club](https://www.islandsailing.org/). And I'll happily to take you sailing if you're local!

📚 I'm big on books, averaging around a novel every two weeks. My favorites are [Kazuo Ishiguro's _The Buried Giant_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22522805-the-buried-giant), [Joshua Gayou's _Worldship Series_](https://www.goodreads.com/series/290886-worldship), and [Katherine J. Chen's _Joan_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59339945-joan).

🏋️ Recently I've been trying to getting into weight lifting. I'm finding it has done great things for my well-being so I'm sticking with it! 

🎹 I also tinker in a very unserious manner on the piano, and sometimes the guitar. I find it's a great way to refresh the brain, let thoughts wander, and solve tricky software architectural issues and the like.
