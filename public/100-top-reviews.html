      "review": "(May 2022) I DNF'd this several times last year for reasons of pacing and a feeling that, though certainly intense, the book lacked depth. I have been unable to stop thinking about why this book didn't work for me ever since, so I picked it up one last time to push through to the end. I'm glad I did. My opinions have not changed, but as is often true with me and three-star reads, I learned a great deal about why the craft in this book didn't come together for me despite a fantastic premise, attractive themes, competent writing, and obvious intention in the execution. If you're only interested in what I liked about the book, skip to the last few paragraphs, but apart from the themes, I think the magic in this book is some of its strongest stuff.<br /><br /><b>A. Pacing &amp; POV</b><br /><br />This book changed POV every chapter. There are more than 70 chapters in this book. That means this book shifted POV, sometimes across time and space, more than 70 times. For a 530-page book, that's a POV shift more often than once every ten pages.<br /><br />It was too many. Even if there were only two POV characters, it would be too many. The fact that there were at least 5 POV characters of differently weighted importance made this story feel fractured and denied a reader investment in the actual plot.<br /><br />What readers enjoy about this book is its characters and themes, which are arguably served by this structure! There is a point near the end where, alternating between Priya and Malini's POV, themes are paralleled between the two series of events. I love that sort of thing, and it's times like those that an alternating POV can become an asset to a story. Sadly, I don't think this potential was actualized through most of the book.<br /><br />Why switch POV so often? I wonder if the author was approaching her book with a certain high concept in mind: showing imperialism and/or uprisings against it from every possible angle. A noble project, and one that high fantasy is perhaps uniquely able to address; it's one of the reasons I keep reading high fantasy, to explore exactly this. If this had pulled off what it wanted to, it could have felt like a holistic tale of a nation coming to terms with how power works within it. Instead, even though threads converged from 5+ into 2 by the end of the book, I felt like I was reading several different stories that happened to take place in the same setting. <br /><br />Because we hopped between them so often, complete understanding of what each character's POV was intended to accomplish thematically felt elusive, while reader investment in the primary story was deprioritized. Throw in that changing POV between chapters came to feel imperative—even if it interrupted flow and momentum to do so—and this book felt incredibly slow. At times it also felt bloated with filler chapters that, while accommodating theme, again killed any sense of movement. Conversations felt repeated, particularly in the middle when Malini is imprisoned (and thus stripped of agency) and Priya, for reasons I still don't understand, only enacts agency within the boundaries of the existing situation instead of, oh, I don't know, getting Malini out of prison.<br /><br />Conversation often felt prioritized over action by this structure. When we flipped POV, it was to get to different people interacting with each other: forming alliances, launching offensives, making decisions. That's good stuff, but it created an emphasis on <em>dynamics</em> at the expense of story propulsion and deeper character motivation. When we did see action, it felt unsupported by scene infrastructure—flat, or otherwise marooned—because there was no sense of building tension or movement between states. <br /><br />Which brings me to—<br /><br /><b>B. Propulsion/Momentum/Movement: Limited Scope &amp; Fits and Starts</b><br /><br />It's not right to say that characters weren't motivated, because they were. I spent the first two-thirds of this book puzzling over why it felt like they weren't motivated when I could identify their motivations on the page. Eventually it clicked: characters were motivated only by what they could see or feel directly in front of them. Priya is motivated to stop Malini from dying when she is in prison because she can see Malini is in prison, she can see her dying in front of her, and she thinks this shouldn't be happening. Getting her out of prison doesn't seem like an option because she can't see beyond the Hirana. <br /><br />There was, in other words, no overarching <em>story</em> momentum—no plot propulsion. Malini is motivated to get out of prison, but Priya doesn't share those motivations. As a result we spend 200 pages repeating conversations and turning in circles. This goes back to the feeling like everyone is living in a different world that happens to be the same world: There is propulsion and forward motion in individual scenes but, thanks to too-frequent POV switches, not in the book as a whole.<br /><br />Where is the plot push to get Malini out of prison? It comes, but too late. Where is the push to find Rukh a cure for his condition? There is no sense of urgency in this book. Near the end it finally occurs to Priya she could find a cure for the rot; and maybe she needed to undergo her character evolution before she felt capable of doing that. But there was no tension presented to this arc. Rukh and the rot is something we see at the very beginning of the book, but Priya gets distracted by a 300-page sideplot in the form of an imprisoned princess whose life she has to save... but like, also she has to stay in jail and wait for someone else to rescue her though. (You can see what I've been hung up on for the last several months of not reading this book.) <br /><br />Both main protagonists undergo a significant process of change through the book. They are not stagnant. They are both acting, trying to move toward something. But it was as though, in each scene they were in, they were standing at a fork in the road with the options, \"Do what's expected of me\" and \"Make a different decision.\" Each time they only make decisions that resolve that individual scene fork rather than looking beyond the room they're in. <br /><br />They weren't one-dimensional; but they were two-dimensional, moving only along two axes. If we spent more time in any one character's head at a go, these sorts of longer arcs might have had time to develop.<br /><br /><b>C. Character and Relationship Motivation &amp; Depth: On the Utility of Intensity</b><br /><br />Right. So. The romance. It did nothing for me. In fact I'm hesitant to call it a romance. Two characters were thrown together by circumstance and they are intense at each other for some time, to the detriment of plot and momentum; finally, alone and free, they kiss. <br /><br />In theory, I see it. Apart from being about imperialism and agency, this story is at its core about female ambition. Priya and Malini are two women who were hardened by the lives they've lived under patriarchal imperialism and who ultimately take their respective destinies by the horns. It's this that motivates their individual fork-choices throughout the story; I'll spoiler an example. <input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"spoiler__control\" aria-label=\"The following text has been marked spoiler. Toggle checkbox to reveal or hide.\" onchange=\"this.labels[0].setAttribute('aria-hidden', !this.checked);\" id=\"0e333b59-376f-48ce-9931-34efbe7ac62f\" /><label aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"spoiler\" for=\"0e333b59-376f-48ce-9931-34efbe7ac62f\">At one point Malini holds a knife to Priya's heart in order to negotiate for what she wants. And she would have killed Priya to get it. It was one of the stronger scenes in the book. It was then immediately undercut by Malini's guilt and sorrow, framed as \"I can't believe I threatened the woman I love.\" I can, and so can you! We were both there! We know exactly why you did that. Own it. Are you ruthless or not, what is this? You can feel like shit about it but at least accept that it was necessary for your overarching goals. It's like she forgot the metaplot right after acting in its service, in order to have emotions; in order to give intensity. That's the kind of thing I'm railing against: she acted in accordance with a fundamental value set, and then wondered why she did it. Stop it! It made sense, and then you undid it just to have a saaaaad conversation with Priya later.</label><br /><br />All to say that I wanted more consistency in this ambition throughout. The ambition to move beyond their circumstances should have been made explicit, repeatedly, in all the different ways it appeared, and made the central thrust of the book; provided the story's propulsion. Like other reviewers, I liked Bhumika a <em>lot</em> more than either Priya or Malini, and it was because she knew what she was about, the book knew what she was about, and she did not waver from what she needed to do. <input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"spoiler__control\" aria-label=\"The following text has been marked spoiler. Toggle checkbox to reveal or hide.\" onchange=\"this.labels[0].setAttribute('aria-hidden', !this.checked);\" id=\"d47cdae5-a23b-4794-ae1a-ee873dc068e3\" /><label aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"spoiler\" for=\"d47cdae5-a23b-4794-ae1a-ee873dc068e3\">At the end of the book she looks at her newborn and decides that she, Bhumika, will still die for her ambitions even if it means leaving her infant an orphan. She does not waver. Thank you! More Bhumika!</label><br /><br />Bhumika's intensity came from a different place than the other two: from her pregnancy, and from the fact that she found herself in a different position under patriarchal imperialism than either of the other women. I found Bhumika's to be a very compelling story for a woman who, at the beginning of the story, was straining at the bounds of her wifehood with a ruthlessly ambitious energy. <br /><br />Also notably, she did not have a romance arc. <br /><br />And I'm not against romance arcs. Again and again in writing this review, I think of <em>She Who Became the Sun</em>, which balanced gendered storylines in an imperial context with queer romance (in my view) considerably better. Maybe this is an unfair comparison! But I think the romance in this book ultimately softened the themes it so beloved. Each woman undercut her own sense of ambition to have little sidebars that didn't really do anything for the story. I would have found it far more compelling if, recognizing their ambitions were similar but didn't quite align, they had stayed antagonistic and mistrusting to each other instead. It was a fundamentally odd feeling to regard a lesbian romance and think how much the romance was taking away from individual characters' power; that's the sort of judgment I expect to make of female characters in heterosexual romance arcs.<br /><br />Interestingly, in the acknowledgments, the author suggests she had not originally planned to make this a sapphic romance until editing. That makes sense to me. There was not a significant depth to this romance, but to be honest I felt very little at any stage of reading this book. This amorphous sense of the relationship's <em>conversational intensity</em> de-prioritized a lot of things that make a relationship matter to me: shared plot stakes, shared motivations, shared destinations.<br /><br /><b>D. I promise I liked some stuff about this book</b><br /><br />I'm only hard on this book because I think the potential is so very there. I do plan to read from this author again later in her career. I <em>wanted</em> morally grey lesbians fighting hard for their own ambition under patriarchal imperialism, and I truly think this same book with a different execution—a shorter, punchier book structured in the interest of longer arcs, greater depth, and building movement, for example—may well have delivered on that promise.<br /><br />When the prose didn't work for me, it was often because the gravitas didn't feel earned because of the reasons listed above. There were some truly gorgeous turns of phrase, and it could have landed a real punch. I also cared immensely about each woman's arc individually, even if I didn't feel they fit together well. It's also clear the author had an enormous, dynamic world in mind, and I want to see what kind of scope she can create when POV switches don't fracture it.<br /><br />Finally, I <em>loved</em> the rot plotline and how magic worked in this world. It's what sucked me into this book in the first place. I want to see a future for this world with a subrace of rot people. The way magic was communicated through earth and water, the idea of thriceborn and how magic is only granted from flirting heavily with death... what ideas!<br /><br />I will only read on in this series if I hear subsequent books are structured quite differently, but I have absolute faith this author could be an incredible powerhouse in the genre a few books down the road, and I can't wait to see what else she does."

      "review": "This took me nearly two weeks to finish and honestly? Totally my fault. I'm not usually a big reader of either adult fiction or high fantasy, but the story sounded so good I decided to give it a try. But, as always, I should trust my instincts and stop trying out what I KNOW will disappoint me. So if I start listing the reasons I gave this book two stars, it's not to say it was bad, but why I, personally, didn't like it.<br /><br />I think my biggest problems with it was the pace and the worldbuilding. Thing is, this an <i>extremely</i> rich book. A good thing about it is that it's super original and definitely a breath of fresh air in the literal tsunami of American/eventually European fiction. Thus, the incorporation of what I understood to be elements from Indian culture(s) made it highly interesting. Moreover, the writing style is very poetic and beautifully descriptive, and several passages truly grabbed my attention. Problem is, there is just so much to say: about the characters, the places, the history, the religion, the politics... it all starts to get extremely confusing to the point I stopped trying to understand. The fact that an element such as the rot is introduced as something really important, but that is then dropped for the entire book and then picked up again at the last minute is just really frustrating to me, for example<br /><br />It's sad to admit but as the book progressed and the story still wasn't picking up, I stopped caring about anything that happened. The plot didn't seem to have a particular purpose; instead it was just a succession of events alternating several confusing POVS (and I thought only Priya's and Malini's would have been enough.) I'm especially saddened that I didn't care one bit about the romance: LGBTQ+ representation is so, so important to me and I'm always weak for a sweet and tragic queer love story but here... I just did not care for it. I thought the characters realized their feelings for each other too quickly, and that they lacked serious chemistry. I totally saw what the author wanted to do (and some scenes were pretty good) but as a whole, it just felt flat and dull, which is the last thing you want for such a thrilling plot line. <input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"spoiler__control\" aria-label=\"The following text has been marked spoiler. Toggle checkbox to reveal or hide.\" onchange=\"this.labels[0].setAttribute('aria-hidden', !this.checked);\" id=\"c9db6c2d-2479-4c2a-b788-b115d9cb041a\" /><label aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"spoiler\" for=\"c9db6c2d-2479-4c2a-b788-b115d9cb041a\">I was honestly also quite disappointed with the reveal of Malini's \"crime\": part of me understands the way queerness is portrayed as this horrible thing society wants to cure, but at the same time I just wanted it to be something different. While I was kind of expecting it, I thought the reveal fell pretty flat, especially after spending most of the book waiting for it. </label><br /><br />So yes, this was honestly not a good reading experience for me. I struggled <b>immensely</b> to finish it, in hope the end would be worth it, but honestly I coudn't care for it either. The idea for the story was obviously great and it has a lot of potential, but the focus on politics in a very dense and confusing world-building made it hard to follow what was going on.<br /><br />"

      "review": "✨⭐ 9.5 out of 10 ⭐✨<br />Chef kissing the book and the author. What an absolutely wonderful book.<br /><br /><b>\n  <i>Keyword: </i>\n</b>high fantasy, Indian inspired, war, nature magic, collonialism and rebellion<br /><b>Trigger and content warning:</b> murder and violence, drug use, internalized homophobia, immolation (execution by fire), suicidal ideation, body horror<br /><b>Representation:</b> Indian-coded characters, lesbian <br /><br /><b>REVIEW</b><br />Do you want to read about strong and unapologetic women rising up to save a dying empire? Then pick this one, you won't regret it.<br /><br />At its premise The Jasmine Throne is about a princess who refuse to be burnt and a mere maidservant with dangerous secret. How their story interwoven, the maidservant searching for herself and tried to make peace with traumas of the past, how the princess perservere even when all odds and the will of empire itself demands her dead. <br /><br />Though not just that, it's also about hope and resistance. In it a nation is beaten and subjugated to collonialism under a dictator emperor. But even with its dying breath, with poverty, mythical epidemic, and unjustice at the nation's door, there are still people who cling to hope and yearn for freedom. It's about the sacrifice and risk one must take to set a freedom.<br /><br />As the first book in the series The Jasmine Throne fare well in introducing us to the magical world of nameless God, Mothers of Flame, and Yaksas. And within it the politics of overthrowing an opressive empire. <br /><br />The many point of views the book contained added more depth and perspectives to the sides involved in it. From the rebellions who raze down everything for greater good, the commoner who want nothing of war and violence, to the politics and scheming of the courts who believe they can correct the wrong of the world.<br /><br />With beautiful prose it help us immersed in it. The narration is passionate and full of emotions. It carried the feeling of the scenes very well whether it is romantic or confrontation. The vibes of the story also feels rich and atmospheric with cultural references.<br /><br />As for the magic system and the wordlbuilding, it is not really extensive or unique, but still interesting. It's a nature-based magic system made more intriguing with touches of Indian cultures and lores as well as Hinduism here and there. The imagery of the plant magic itself is vivid, cool, and sometimes eerie.<br /><br />Another thing worth mentioning is how the book filled with strong women, each trying in their own way to make the world a better place. Among my favorite is Lady Bhumika, the General's pregnant wife who oftenly underestimated and looked down upon. But turned out she's more than what she seems as.<br /><br />The romance aspect of the book is slow burn, starting with bad notes to me but slowly getting me in. I like how the main characters navigate their relationship and start putting trust in each other. And how they overcome distrust, hurt, and vulnerabilities. The payoff from the romance buildup is really satisfying to read too. And the plus point it's queer af!<br /><br />Aside from romantic, the book also revolved around familial bonds and friendship. And it also fare well in that regard. <br /><br />Overall, this book left a glowing impression on me. I can really see why booktwitter folks calling it part of the sapphic trifecta of 2021. Really worth to read, recommended.<br /><br />Thank you Netgalley for the e-arc copy of this awesome book!<br />"

      "review": "I’m going to need someone to recommend me a good fantasy series with southeast asian mythology elements because this book was so incredibly poorly executed but had an amazing premise…! I can’t believe I bought the physical copy of this book, what a waste. Two stars because at least the ideas were novel.<br /><br />I sped through the first 100 pages or so. The beginning is compelling, especially the prologue. But the worldbuilding and plot quickly devolve into meaningless repetition. <br /><br />A key aspect of storytelling is that EVERY SCENE must have one of three values to the story: <br />1. Positive value, in which new information, new characters, new important items are added; <br />2. Negative value, in which elements are removed from the story by way of character death, an item is used for its purpose (ex. A gun introduced in act one goes off at the end of act two), some information is used to end an arc (a secret is revealed to the wrong person, and there is some consequence.)<br />3. Neutral value, in which the established information within the story is twisted or reframed in some manner so that the audience develops a new understanding of the story so far. This is the hardest type of scene to execute, and it is clear this author has no idea how to do so. Nearly every scene in this 576-page novel contains reiteration of information the audience already knows, without adding to it or subverting it in any way.<br /><br />I’ll try to give examples of what I mean, so the rest of this will likely have spoilers. My thesis statement for this review is: this book needed a developmental editor! <br /><br />1. After the introductory sections of the book, we come to understand that there are monsters called yaksa, who used to rule the world in the Age of Flowers until a group of women burned themselves to death and imbued their rebel army’s weapons with power to kill the monsters. The author seems to think that her audience has the memory of a goldfish, and is intent on reminding us of these founding myths over and over again. EVERY character reiterates these myths and casually thinks about them in the same manner, and it genuinely feels as though the author thinks we don’t understand the story. <br /><br />2. The dialogue reads like a couple of robots explaining their motives to one another, in the same manner, in every scene. Priya does not want to show her brother Ashok the way to the magical river that will save his life, because he will use its power to help his rebel group to kill their oppressing nation. Then, every time the two of them are speaking to each other, it’s the same platitudes over and over again, Priya just saying “no, because” and Ashok saying “but I’ll die”. Over and over! Bhumika and Priya have an initial interesting conversation and it’s revealed that Priya resents Bhumika for her relative privilege for escaping the mass murder of the temple children. Then every conversation is Priya being hostile to Bhumika. Nothing changes. The same goes for conversations between Priya and Malini, between Bhumika and Ashok, and even Rao is a little affected, but at least Rao’s plotline has the most “new information” in each scene.<br /><br />3. A few other reviewers have pointed out the “overwriting,” which is the most egregious sin the book commits. There are hundreds of sentences in which the information stated can be inferred by the previous sentence. It’s the opposite of a tightly written story, and makes for an insulting reading experience. <br /><br />4. Characters tell each other information that the audience has already explicitly been told. This would not be a problem if there was some consequence to giving these characters these pieces of information, but in reality absolutely nothing happens. When you look at the important events of this book on a large scale, what happens is : 1. A rebel sneaks into the temple to try to force the last temple daughter to reveal the magic rivers, and the temple daughter kills her; 2. The princess accuses the dead rebel of being an assassin and the regent has artists in the city killed as punishment to the rebels; 3. The rebels attack the city, which results in the province having no leader, the princess escaping, and a new rebel faction forming. But these three important beats are flanked by multiple scenes of people receiving information that THEY DON’T ACT ON. We learn from Rao’s perspective that he’s in the city to find a way to save Malini. Then, Malini sends Priya to go talk to Rao about saving her, but Priya tells Rao he probably doesn’t have a chance of saving her. Then, she goes back to Malini and is told to tell Rao to leave the city. Nobody cares!! Rao ends up not saving Malini, and Priya finally decides to do it after seventy pages of waffling about it. <br /><br />Maybe the biggest problem with this book is the multiple perspectives, which contributes to the problem of the audience already knowing everything that’s being discussed in every scene. <br /><br />Additional problems with the book, besides the overwriting, are the poor character writing, complete lack of character development (hey, did you know characters are supposed to change over the course of a story? Now you do!), and random prose issues. All character voices sound the same (everyone speaks the same way, and makes long monologues at each other about their own beliefs in multiple scenes), and more complex words are inserted in the middle of scenes as though the author was overusing a thesaurus (the word “perfunctorily” is used again and again, etc). The author struggles with where to use “her” versus the character’s names when multiple female characters are in a scene. A few examples of awkward sentences: “Power doesn’t have to be the way the regent and your rebels make it be”/ “oh, priya knew an infatuation when she was in the middle of one” which are both grammatically correct, but odd. <br />General YA/romantasy sins of this book include: <br />- overuse of sentence fragments (“Malini finally raised her eyes. Deep, dark. Considering.”) -*sentence fragments are fine in moderation*<br />- starting new paragraphs with the word “And” to create a feeling of momentum, but this is overused and so does not have the desired effect<br />- when describing, using the phrase “all (adjective) and (adjective)”, an overused phrase in YA and romantasy<br />- believing that adding italics and elipses to scenes with the romantic leads will create romantic tension between them<br /><br />I’m most disappointed by the romance because it’s so empty; the author should have leaned full YA if she was going to write sapphic characters without physical passion (as in internal emotion, I don’t care about intimacy scenes), and there’s never any romantic tension either. Their friendship starts out believable, but quickly becomes repetitive scenes, and there’s a lot of overt stating of the distrust between them when we never see the reason for that. <br /><br />The emperor is a mustache-twirling baddie when we never see him except in the prologue, and every single character believes he is evil, but he does not think he’s a monster. It would have been interesting to follow that up with some development for him, but alas. <br /><br />ALSO, the “rebels” should have given themselves A NAME!! You’re telling me these rebels have been around for at least as long as Priya has been a handmaiden and they haven’t decided on a name yet? Reading “the rebels” over and over again makes you feel like you’re in a Star Wars book, and I thought this novel was going for less symbolic and more practical worldbuilding. <br /><br />Finally, the worldbuilding “can’t be pinned like a bird by its wing”, as one overused metaphor in this book would say; that is, there’s very few elements of the world that feel real. There’s a distinct lack of proper description for fascinating new places like the Hirana and the mahal, so we can never truly understand the scale of the settings. The market seems to be the only section of the city besides the “pleasure district.” A particularly egregious example is Malini’s room, which supposedly once held an entire banquet full of people that burned to death, and yet every scene with Malini and Priya feels like they’re in a small prison cell. How many people lived at the temple in its heyday? How many people live in this “city” which is supposedly the capital of this province? How many guards from Parijat are occupying this city? No one knows, least of all the author. <br />"

      "review": "I have to admit, I was queer-baited into reading this (yet again). I felt disappointed in the same way as when I watch lesbian costume drama's. But, to be fair, that's on me. I usually prefer books without romance as (one of) their main plot(s), but when it comes to sapphic books I suddenly need a whole lot of action. If you're a fan of slow burning romances, then you're going to love this. <br /><br />This book is told from many different points of view, something I tend to dislike. Especially when they are so clearly used as a tool for the author to explain certain parts of the plot and not adding much else to the story than the info dump. Which was - in my opinion - in some instances the case. <br />I mainly liked Malini's cunning, morally grey and relentless character and Bhumika - the big sister who can be mean and stern but is actually very wise and always right (and secretly also very loving). With a relatively big cast of characters and many points of view, I can imagine it's more challenging to make all of them interesting, something I think this book didn't entirely succeed in.<br /><br />But, they were interesting enough to get me hooked, and especially the setting caught my attention. Unfortunately, the ending didn't feel satisfying to me. It felt like the book promised a big reveal and plot twist at the end, all the pieces of the puzzle finally coming together in a mind-boggling way. Instead, the end was incredibly predictable and made me regret putting all my energy in reading the rather unnecessary and extensive middle part/progress of the book. Maybe it could have been a great ending if my expectations hadn't been steered in a different direction, because the story in itself is still pretty awesome.<br /><br />So, even though I liked the setting, the feministic themes, everything lesbian and some characters, in the end the book just felt like too many words and a disappointing climax."

      "review": "Awesome world building and characters in a story themed around colonization, death, belief, the young vs the old, class, gender and sexuality, love, and power. All from the point of view of lesbian POC protagonists! <br /><br />Really a breath of fresh air, although I guess that depends on how you define this book's genre. If you compare it to Lord of the Rings, then it is a breath of fresh air in a genre filled with male leads, damsels in distress, and a mythos largely inspired by European folklore. If you see it as a YA novel, maybe the protagonists personalities contain some well trodden tropes? <br /><br />But really, it is the author's ability to write these characters that makes them more than the sum of their parts. I particularly found Priya, Malini, and Bhumika to be quite compelling. Even some characters who are a little bit less in focus, like Vikram, Rao, Ashok, or Aditya felt like real people with little details about them that really bring them to life. In that sense, I think the Song of Fire and Ice series is a good comparison. Not quite as overwhelming in the sheer number of characters, but a similar level of character depth, world building, lore, and expansiveness. In general, you can just tell that the author really put a lot of thought into every character and the world, and it's fantastic!<br /><br />That being said, I am not a lesbian, and while I personally found the lesbian romance compelling, I would be curious to see how different lesbian/bi women feel about this aspect. But I definitely love the way this book puts a strong focus on the role of women in these societies, which may be different from ours in some ways may be more similar than we would like... <br /><br />I saw a blurb about the book that says it is set in a world \"inspired by ancient India\". This isn't entirely wrong, per say, but I think it could give the false impression that this is some sort of historical fiction. Really, the author has created her own rich fantasy world with magic and prophecies and its own complex history. The \"Indian inspiration\" (which is really more than just India) is related to things like clothing that the characters wear, food they eat, environment, architecture, and the words chosen by the author to name and describe those things. Character and place names are inspired by both modern and ancient South Asian languages (from Sanskrit to Urdu), but are not directly linked to real places. But that doesn't mean you can't find similarities. <br /><br />My only microscopic complaint about this is that at one point a character refers to the world as existing on a sub-continent. That seemed a bit too on the nose to me, but I thought about it more and who am I to judge? Why can't fantasy world's have sub-continents too, sure. It does make me wonder if there are people and cultures outside of the sub-continent, and if they will play a role at any point in this series? But if they don't that's totally fine, I'm fact good keep them out.<br /><br />There is no Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, Christianity, etc in this book, the author created her own unique and interesting religions. But at the same time you can't help but feel some social commentary coming from these fictional religions, in a good way. Especially as they tie into the broader themes of colonialism, empire, and class, and gender roles, and how these themes affect each of the characters and their world.<br /><br />Overall, awesome and deep book to get lost in and make you feel things and think about the world."

After being betrayed by her brother, Malini has been left to watch her empire fall to ruin. Malini is almost entirely isolated in her temple prison, alone except for the maidservant who comes to clean her chambers each night. Priya, the aforementioned maidservant, needs the anonymity that comes with being a servant. No one thinks to suspect someone in her position to have secrets, especially those of the magical variety. But, when Malini uncovers Priya’s true nature, their fates become intertwined. Between the two of them, Malini and Priya have the potential to burn the empire to the ground or to save it once and for all.<br /><br />You can get your copy of The Jasmine Throne on June 8th from Orbit Books!<br /><br />I cannot rave enough about this book! It has one of my all-time favorite fantasy romance pairings because Priya and Malini are absolutely irresistible. Their partnership has a certain edge to it that I believe comes from a perfectly executed “enemies-to-lovers” plotline. I mean, who can say “no” to morally gray protagonists falling in love?<br /><br />The Jasmine Throne also does an incredible job exploring the theme of monstrosity and femininity, namely how society treats women it views as monstrous. Priya and Malini both undermine and defy their societally expected roles, and are thereby viewed as monsters. This serves both to add depth to the characters’ narratives and to make a larger statement on society as a whole, adding yet another layer of relevance to the story!<br /><br />After finishing reading my traditional copy, I immediately purchased the audiobook, so that I can relive the story with the added magic of narration! I will post an audiobook review once I am finished listening, to let you know how it compares to my regular read-through!<br /><br />My Recommendation-<br />This incredible high fantasy novel would be a great read for fans of strong, queer protagonists with questionable morality! I would especially recommend The Jasmine Throne to readers who loved The Unbroken, The Priory of the Orange Tree, and Beyond the Ruby Veil!<br />"

      "review": "Full disclosure: I received an ARC from the publisher via NetGalley in exchange for my honest review.<br /><br />Content warning: forced drug use, homophobia, torture, body horror, murder (via forced suicide)<br /><br />Malini is the only sister of the emperor of Parijatdvipa, imprisoned because she refused to self-immolate when the emperor demanded it of her. In a fit of cruel irony, Emperor Chandra has ordered her drugged and imprisoned in the Hirana, an abandoned Ahiranyi temple that died when the priests had self-immolated on the previous emperor’s orders. Priya, a maidservant who has been tasked with cleaning the Hirana nightly, was a temple servant of the Hirana when she was a child. Now, she secretly seeks to fill in the gaps in her memory around her life there before everyone died. When Malini accidentally learns part of Priya’s secret, it brings the two women together in ways that will change the world.<br /><br />I should have liked this book more. It has so many pieces I enjoy, such as rich, culturally diverse world building, a complex political situation, and strong, fascinatingly flawed women characters. There’s even a weird plague that kills people by slowly turning them into trees. There’s a great deal of depth to the pieces of this story, but there were two places where I struggled to connect with it. The first is pacing and the second was the romance between Priya and Malini.<br /><br />I struggled with the pacing in this novel. For so much of the book, I felt like the story was going nowhere. I could see the political situation reaching a tipping point and could see how the revelation of the characters’ backstories was building toward something as they were revealed, but it was hard to see what that was until very near the end and there was very little action until things reached that tipping point. I liked the plot and I liked the ending, which is an excellent setup for book 2, but I struggled to get to the end where it all came together. Part of that may have been tied to the tone, which is on the dark side of epic fantasy. It’s darker than I’ve been in the mood for lately, so it’s entirely possible that this book would hit me differently when reread later.<br /><br />I also struggled to connect with Priya and Malini’s relationship. I enjoyed each character individually, but I didn’t find them interesting together. Both are secretive women, and while “I’m lonely and I find you intriguing” is a perfectly valid reason for two characters to get together, I felt like the relationship jumped too fast from “I don’t know or trust you” to the strong feelings they had for each other at the end. I will also say that I think I’m in the minority on that point, based on other early reviews that loved the queer romance story between those characters, so take my opinion here as you will.<br /><br />With that said, there is a lot to like here. There are so many strong women in this book, all of whom are strong in different ways and exercise power in different ways. Priya is physically powerful and courageous. Malini’s power comes from her political savviness and charisma. Bhumika’s power comes from her ability to placate and disarm her colonizer husband while cultivating loyalty among her people. I loved reading the ways they navigate the deeply misogynistic world around them, both fighting the constraints the world has placed on them and manipulating those situations to bring them some advantage.<br /><br />I do think this is an epic fantasy worth reading and I plan to read book 2. There are a lot of interesting plot points set up at the end, so I’m excited to see where the series goes next and how the author decides to develop these characters further. This is a more ambitious, complex work than Suri’s Books of Ambha series and I think she pulls it off here, despite the reservations I mentioned earlier. If you’re looking for a feminist epic fantasy with a tone on the darker end of the spectrum and enjoy morally gray characters, culturally diverse world building (in this case, inspired by the epics and history of India), and queer representation, then this is the book for you."

      "review": "This book was excellent. At first, I was quite confused due to the different stories, characters, and the logistics of the belief systems and positions. As I continued and things began to make more sense, this book was quite enjoyable.<br /><br />It begins with a princess named Malini, required to sacrifice herself at a pyre with her two attendants in respect to the \"Mothers of Flame\", and when she refuses, she is outcast by her brother, Emperor Chandra, and sentenced to life in prison. Then, there is also a servant girl named Priya who, in her down time, wishes to help village children that have become sick with \"the rot\" which is a disease that caused a lot of the body to be changed into nature--roots, bark, leaves, buds--and it is believed to be a curse given to this part of the empire by the temple children, who burned along with their elders. As the story advances Priya becomes Malini's maidservant and they try to devise a plan to save themselves--Malini wishing to overthrow her brother, and Priya wishing to understand herself, her past, and her meaning. We eventually learn many things about the temple children, the corrupt empire, the rot, and why so many wish to stick to their beliefs.<br />The story does a great job combining elements of fate, self-discovery, and family all while providing us with powerful, feminist main characters that happen to fall in love and strive to take down patriarchal roles in society.<br /><br />I completely loved the wlw representation in the story and was mesmerized by the way the author described many scenes. The hair washing and the waterfall moments were beautifully written and will forever be some of my favorite book-tension moments.<br /><br />\"'I am your loyal servant, my lady,\" she said hurriedly, filling the silence. 'You can tell me whatever you wish.'<br />Malini was silent for a time, as Priya untangled her hair, as the water dripped to the floor.\" (Page 151).<br /><br />My favorite thing about this book, though, is the strong female leads and how they overturn the patriarchal systems and misogyny they face. Most important to note is Bhumika. Besides feeling so connected to her, and relating to many characteristics, her journey in the story is amazing. She always knew who she was and stayed true to herself, even when many things around her allowed her to be the opposite. She was able to harness this understanding of herself, and eventually step into her power. Slay queen. Feminism was such a major role in this book and I think the author portrayed it perfectly.<br /><br />\"In her years of marriage, Bhumika had made sure of one thing, at least: Vikram was the master of his mahal, but the first loyalty of the majority of maids and children, the soldiers and serving men, those who cooked the food and set the fires, and held arrows and swords against the dark, was to her.<br />She--the regent's kindly wife, his vapid dove--had saved them. She had given them work and a home. And she demanded nothing in return.\" (Page 171).<br /><br />Besides those two things which set the book to be amazing for me was simply the plot and the storyline. The way the romance began and the two main characters developed their trust. The crossover of characters and their journeys. The morally grey elements and how characters discovered themselves. The way the story eventually all fit together. The way certain scenes were detailed and described. The medium pace and the perfect amount of information given. All of it came together to create a great story.<br /><br />\"Pramila snorted. 'And what tales can she tell you, princess? She's likely not even literate. Are you, girl?'<br />'I am an Ahirani maid,' Priya said, which was not exactly an agreement. 'And no more.'<br />Malini smiled at her, the barest lift of the corners of her lips, and saw the maidservant's eyes widen a little.<br />Surely, they both knew that was a lie.\" (Page 140).<br /><br />The only thing, though, is that although I rated this 5 stars and loved the book, I will probably not read the second due to the fact that I don't feel completely emotionally attached to the characters or plot to continue reading and wanting to know what happens. The book ended in a way where many questions and loose ends were answered and there is not an immediate need to read the second.<br />Regardless, I LOVED this story and I would 10/10 recommend.<br /><br />(Content warnings as far as I can remember: misogyny, homophobia, one scene with slight domestic abuse, a scene or two containing slight family abuse, violence, burning, gore/blood, murder, public execution, poisoning/nonconsensual drug use.)"

Those details were easily my favourite aspects of the story. <br /><br />The narrative itself was very slow burning. Certainly, there was action along the way, but the interrelationships took focus over the political details. The book is quite long, as is common in epic fantasy, but personally I thought the story could have been edited down into a tighter narrative. <br /><br />There is a Sapphic romance at the center of the story between the two prominent perspectives. I always appreciate queer representation in my fiction. Personally, I prefer more passionate relationships, rather than slow burning romance, but I understand the cultural reasons why the interactions never got heated.<br /><br />This is the first book in a trilogy.

      "review": "2.5 stars rounded up<br /><br />Let me preface this review by saying that I love fantasy and queer lit, so works at the intersection of these genres are usually ones I appreciate. I also was expecting to enjoy this one and was a generous reader for at least the first half of this novel.<br /><br />There are some interesting and beautiful elements to this novel, and the writing itself is not the issue (it is lovely at times). However, at about the halfway mark I wondered how much longer we were going to have what seemed to be prequel-like storytelling, the continued audience-in-ignorance description, and the character interactions which seemed to describe the same dynamic or story over and over again (rather than something than is advancing the character development or plot). <br /><br />The main issues I had with this novel are as follows:<br /><br />1. The pacing &amp; world-building: As stated above, much of this text (even perhaps as much as 3/4 of it) is spent setting the stage for action. However, this foundation building (which can be thoroughly enjoyable when executed well) was repetitive rather than varied and complex. I never had the sense that we were really building toward anything. I put these two issues together because the way in which the world is revealed to us as readers is slow and superficial. Certainly we can expect to be kept in the dark and to have several questions after the first installation in the series, but *so* many central magical and political elements are simply never explained except with the most basic description (I'm thinking here of the various sections of empire, the deathless waters, the magic of the temple children, the yaksa, the nameless, etc.). In some cases, we get a bit more information at the very end, but it isn't satisfying. <br /><br />[some spoilers below] <br /><br />2. Main character/romance: I knew there was a sapphic romance in this text, but if I hadn't I would have had no idea to expect one. There is no palpable romance between Priya and Malini, their link, or even attraction, is completely unbelievable and feels absolutely forced. There's more chemistry between Malini and literally anyone than Priya. I found this particularly disappointing. Aside from the fact that the romance between them is entirely out of place, undeveloped, etc. it is really difficult to be invested in any relationship that Priya is in, since as a main characters she is so unlikeable, so foolish and selfish (what a combo), particularly toward her sister Bhumika (the most interesting character in this novel, imo). I won't get into detail about the myriad moments Priya acts in the most self-centered ways (because spoilers), but it's absolutely infuriating (it would be less so if this was a better paced, or even shorter, text).<br /><br />3. Predictability: About half way through, I could have predicted all of the major events of this novel. Now, I don't believe that a novel's quality is based on the number of twists and surprises, but in a novel that spends *so much time* making us repeat foundational information and character interactions, it was deeply unsatisfying not to have even the pleasure of being surprised at the end. I will say that the end events are themselves satisfying to a degree, but how we get there essentially strips the reading experience of pleasure. Empress Malini? Awesome. Queen Bhumika? Even better. Except that we knew this would happen and path to get there was a slog.<br /><br />4. Missed opportunities: While I think Malini's character had potential, so much of the novel is either wasted on Priya or through Priya's eyes that she doesn't get the development she deserves until the very end. The most interesting character, and certainly the one you can sympathize with the most from the three siblings, is Bhumika. Bhumika is smart, powerful, and has the burden of the world on her shoulders, in addition to dealing with the stupidities of her siblings. She spends her time trying to reduce the violence she can, feeding and clothing whoever she can, etc. We have the sense that Bhumika is profoundly alone. She can depend on no one, certainly not her sister, who finds a way to abandon her at every possible opportunity, including when she is giving birth during a rebellion (!). <br /><br />I want to know Bhumika's history, and I want to know her future--I even want to know Malini's!--but I'm not sure if that's enough to persuade me to read the next in the series. <br /><br />"

      "review": "SECOND READ EDIT AT THE END!<br /><br />First Read, July 2021: This book was slow to start, but interesting to sit with. At around 240 pages I got really into it and couldn’t put it down. At the start I was worried it would be pro-colonizer and supremacy, but it ended up being so much more complicated and nuanced than that. <br /><br />I greatly appreciate how character driven this story is. The plot unfurls because all the characters in the story are complex and responding to an impossible, terrible situation. And depending on who they are personally as well as where their allegiances lie externally, they make different choices, and the plot moves forward when these choices clash into each other. <br /><br />That being said, it was very long. Probably because to understand why things occur the reader needs to read multiple perspectives on it making the story not very fast paced, but fascinating if you have interest in psychology and ethics and religion. <br /><br />So if you like constant action, this book isn’t for you. But if you like constant tension and feeling like you’re always on a knifes edge trying to balance, I would definitely recommend this. <br /><br />However I do think the last 100 pages dragged a bit. But I understand, there were a lot of ends that needed to be tied up. But wow there was just a lot of talking and discussing and negotiating. I like the ethics of talking and negotiating though and it was very well written so fine for me, but again, if you don’t, this might not be the book for you.<br /><br />Also, side note. I weirdly loved how sexism was portrayed in this book. Which is strange because I’m so tired of fantasy novels using it to justify the sexualization or lack of female characters (some fantasy written by men) or carelessly and bluntly thrown in so the female protagonist can cheaply be seen as “strong” and fighting against an easily constructed system (some fantasy written by women (which isn’t always bad, I’m just personally tired of it)) to the point that I often just ask for fantasy to be done without it. I don’t care if your fantasy world is based off of medieval Europe or Africa or Asia or somewhere where sexism was a thing, that time period also didn’t have dragons so STAWP. <br /><br />But the existence of it here seemed carefully thought out and smoothly woven into the story. There were layers to it, as there is in real life. And also, despite it having an effect on the story, it settles into the background and setting as we focus on the incredible women of this story (and the men of this story) as they navigate the political sh*tshow in this story. <br /><br />So thanks The Jasmine Throne for showing me that if you do something that has slowly started to irritate me to the point I prefer to avoid it altogether is done WELL, then it’s no longer a pain point for me.<br /><br /><br />SECOND READ-THROUGH REVIEW Dec 2022:<br /><br />This book is SO GOOD! All the pain points I established in the first review weren’t there in the second read. And I think that has to do with context. <br /><br />The first time I read this, I was on a queer book binge. I picked this book up solely because I knew there was a lesbian romance in it. Also with the intention of reading it in one sitting. It is a high complement to this book that even when approaching it with the wrong mindset, I adored it so much. To the point that this book remained in my head for a year and a half. And I kept thinking back on it. And reading the authors other books. <br /><br />But the first time I read it, my gripe was that the romance wasn’t that “believable” and that it dragged a bit at the end. On my reread, I don’t believe that at all. <br /><br />The headspace I was in for my second read didn’t have much interest in romance. And it also wasn’t in the mood to binge. I read this book over a 2-ish week period. And I found that the romance was compelling and complex, because it WASN’T a romance. It was two people with a mutual attraction, but both had their own stories and motives that it literally COULDN’T flourish. Not in the way most romances do. And while I suspect it will further down the road, focusing on the romance of this book will do it a huge disservice. This book is complex and fascinating and brilliant. If you’re reading it for just one part, you’re going to miss the big picture. <br /><br />This book shouldn’t be binged. This book should be savored. And after reading it the first time, having it live in my head rent free for years, and then rereading it with a better understanding and reverence, this one has to be added to my favorite books of all time. Along with this author for one of my favorite authors of all time (considering I’ve loved her other works)"

      "review": "3.5<br /><br />The worldbuilding in this story was fresh and well-thought-out. The descriptions of the Hirana were vivid, and I really felt like I was transported there while reading. Conceptually, it worked well too. I like that it seemed more like a living thing than a structure, especially with how it interacted with Priya, and to a lesser extent, the other temple children.<br /><br />The main characters were excellent. Malini was very well done in that she had a great deal of depth to her, and the author was able to explore many different facets of her character in while she was essentially stuck in the same place for most of the story. Her hatred for her brother is totally justified. Her motives made sense. She was strong, cunning, charming, and vulnerable at the same time, and I'm looking forward to where her arc goes in the next book. I enjoyed Priya too, but I felt like I knew less about her than I did Malini. Though, that seemed intentional because Priya was still figuring things out herself for most of the book in terms of what she really wanted and who she really was. And honestly, I was there for that journey. It's a parallel to finding oneself as being any kind of queer person, and it resonated. The romance between the two of them progressed in a way that made sense for two lesbians existing in a world where their love was not allowed by the current ruling kingdom, and when they finally got together my brain was like, \"Oh that's some cute shit right there\".<br /><br />Which brings me to one of my criticisms: It took way too long for the main characters to meet. The pacing of this book, especially in this first third, was slow. Too slow for my tastes, and I found myself skim-reading some parts just to get things moving.<br /><br />The overload of multiple POVs and their swaps didn't help matters, and it was easy to lose focus. The only side character POVs I liked reading where Bhumika's and to some extent, Rao's. I couldn't care less about anyone else's, and I think nearly all of them could have been cut entirely, as their inclusion didn't really add much to the overall story. The events that happened in them were things we didn't actually need to know as readers, or could have gotten through the lens of the main characters, which would have been more impactful if that had been the case.<br /><br />As an example there's a chapter on page 207 from a character we'd never met prior. He shows up and is killed by rebels at the end. The chapter is there to give that information, but that information is then repeated elsewhere in later instances.<br /><br />Another example, very similar to the previous, is on page 340. Yet another character we'd never met prior shows up only to also be promptly murdered. The chapter, presumably, is there to show the return of the neat plant-based magic, however, that's also later shown in multiple instances.<br /><br />There's also a General Vikram chapter where he dies and, again, not needed. <br /><br />A rule of thumb for writing, in my opinion, is that the inclusion of a POV should add something to the story whether that be worldbuilding, plot, or character progression. It shouldn't be there if the information contained within will just be repeated later on. <br /><br />Most of Ashok's chapters were also as unnecessary. I don't think they added anything we didnt, or couldn't, get elsewhere. Some of Priya and Bhumika's chapters already gave information on how they felt about him as a person, how they were connected to him in the past, and how they were affected by his actions. All of the 'what the minor antagonist (I say minor because Chandra is the major) is doing behind the scenes' stuff wasn't really interesting because I knew the conflict would eventually come to the main characters, and I was more interested in knowing how they would deal with it. The focus shifts to Ashok were a mistake for the narrative.<br /><br />That being said, the only extra POV I think worked was Chandra's, which was at the end. And it was only effective because we spent the entire narrative building up how awful he was, then, to get that little taste in the epilogue... *chef's kiss* That's a good example of a POV swap as it also leaves some tension going into the next installment.<br /><br />I am looking forward to seeing Priya and Malini destroy him (hopefully).

      "review": "I had a hard time settling into the audiobook b/c there was so much to keep track of, including so many proper nouns. It's easier for me to remember new words when I see them written. At 23% of the way through:<br />- I'd given up on intentionally trying to track everything and just figured I'd miss out on some details, but still get the gist of the story.<br />- I thought the most compelling storyline was \"the girl who was a temple child - Priya?\"<br /><br /><b>1/18/2023 @ 37% complete:</b><br /><br />- It's a slow-moving story, which makes me glad to listen to the audiobook while I'm doing other things rather than devoting my full attention to reading the Kindle.<br />- I'm happy to hear the audiobook narrator pronounce proper nouns. They're beautiful. Transitioning to the Kindle I realize I wouldn't pronounce them like she does, so I like having the proper pronunciation in my head as I read.<br />- I probably would have quit listening/reading a long time ago if I didn't know (from the original book summary) that Priya and Malini are going to get together. It's a long time coming, though! The feminist themes are good, and so are the casual references to queer romance, but neither is enough to keep me reading on their own. I'm looking forward to a queer romance in a book that's outside the romance genre.<br />- Suri's world-building is subtle and thorough. I'm impressed, especially after some of the other sci fi / fantasy I've read recently (world-building is really not my thing, which is why I prefer speculative fiction). The Ahirani (sp) folklore themes - trees, wood, burning - emerge gradually, in layers. The layers add so much complexity, which is impressive.<br />- Suri's writing is really good! Not pulpy like some other sci fi / fantasy I've tried. Her imagery is beautiful and her character development feels real.<br /><br /><b>1/19/2023 @ 70% complete:</b><br /><br />Realizing that this is an EPIC so it's SUPPOSED to be slow. It's like all those other epics that are popular these days (Game of Thrones, Wheel of Time, Outlander). It's SUPPOSED to be all about political intrigue, social machinations, and grand wartime strategy. <br /><br />Realizing I am not a fan of this genre! Listening to this story is like playing chess or doing maths. All surface on the surface. I'm much more interested in character study and personal transformation. Upon reflection I'm thinking that's probably why this is my first experience with this genre - no interest - and that the feminism and sapphism in this book make it one of the few epics I can tolerate.<br /><br />Again glad I'm listening while doing other things b/c it's not suuuuper holding my attention. P and M still haven't hooked up yet :( I agree with some other reviews I've read: their attraction isn't too believable. So far they seem to just be using each other to get what they each need/want, rather than being invested in each other as people.<br /><br />How is an epic different from a soap opera? How are epics and soaps different from a series?<br /><br /><b>1/21/2023 - Finally Finished!!</b><br />I gave this 2 stars because this last push was such a slog. The writing (words) is lyrical and lovely but everything else is not. It's just not my book. Especially because the love story - the reason I picked it up - felt unbelievable and forced.<br /><br />I bristle at the idea that during a war the rules are different. War is an extra-ordinary time when you're allowed to behave in extra-ordinary ways. I think that opens the door to a LOT of abuse and... fantasy? E.g., P and M have this affection for each other, but they've never interacted under NORMAL circumstances. So do they *really* know each other? Similarly, P's brother (forget his name) acted like a dick 90% of the time, with the unspoken justification \"because war.\"<br /><br />I also dislike the lofty ideals that war invokes. Freedom, etc. I think it's bullshit. Again, extra-ordinary - almost an altered mental state. But it's manipulative. I dislike stories like these, too, because the main characters aren't injured/don't die. Heroes don't die. They struggle and survive. E.g., when M was going to stab P because of P's brother - and suddenly B appeared to save the day. THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN IN REAL LIFE. At least, it didn't when I was raped. The bad thing happened to me. I guess I resent the safety main characters have in these allegories. It's false. It would feel truer if a main character died.<br /><br />I guess the ending, where both P and M ascend to their full power (P a temple elder; M the next emperor) is kind of a cool parallel, and sets thing up nicely for the next book. I will DEFINITELY, ABSOLUTELY NOT be reading the next book, though!<br /><br />Quote:<br /><br />\"She [Malini] learned that day to turn a carapace of meekness rather than showing the true mettle of her fury. She learned, when Chandra [her brother who became emperor] hacked her hair, that <b>there was a way she was expected to be, and if she failed to be it, there would be a price to pay</b>.\" (240 - emphasis mine)<br /><br /><b>UPDATE 1/23/2023</b><br />Kirsten pointed out that this story doesn't have much of a sense of humor about itself, which is 100% true and probably a reason I struggled! So, so serious. Way more serious than the subject warrants imo."

      "review": "First of all, love love love the concept. We need more sapphic Desi representation because it is absolutely in our history, much as some may like to deny it. I also liked that this was primarily a political novel about a burgeoning revolution, more so than a romance. Also, the magical realism?!?!?! 1000% my favorite part about this story, I simply could not get enough of it. Those passages were hands-down my favorite ones.<br /><br />It's clear that this is meant to be a series; this 500+ page book is entirely focused on setting things up; it's written in a way that makes it obvious. The last few chapters were captivating enough, though, that I do want to read the second book -- the action that's promised in there is what I'm really looking forward to reading. This book just lays all the groundwork for that.<br /><br />So, things I loved:<br />- The worldbuilding, especially the magic and the different nations and their respective cultures<br />- The politics (love me a good \"revolution is coming\" premise)<br />- The multiple strong, smart, compelling women (Bhumika is 1000% my fave omg)<br /><br />All that said, there are a few things I didn't love (aka why this wasn't a five star read for me):<br />- In spite of all the darkness and trauma in this world, I still couldn't figure out whether I liked Priya or Malini. Their characterizations weren't solid enough to where I could really decide how I felt about them, or if I even liked them particularly. Maybe this is an issue that'll be resolved in the second book, as things unfold more dramatically and as the author settles into the characters more.<br />- The romance was SO understated? I don't understand why everyone on TikTok was screaming about the waterfall scene?? I didn't feel any sort of true chemistry build up between Priya and Malini over the course of the book to make the romance between them feel believable, and that left me feeling a little disappointed.<br />- The writing... it was kind of a hit-or-miss for me throughout. I really liked it in some moments, and in others I found myself rewriting the sentences on the page, thinking \"I'd have worded it this way instead.\" That was a bit distracting.<br /><br />All in all, though, I enjoyed this read (if my reaching for it between 10-minute intervals between class and meetings is any indication), and I'll keep my eyes peeled for the next one in August!"

      "review": "The Jasmine Throne is Indian inspired epic fantasy, with an emphasis on epic. As I have come to expect from this author, lush worldbuilding offers an immersive experience for the reader to delve into richly described settings that touch on all the senses, with forbidden tales of origin and folklore giving glorious magical depth. Told through multiple points of view, two main characters take centre stage: Priya, a maidservant with a complex past, and Malini, an imperial princess of Parijadvipa, and traitor to her people.<br />The lives of these two women come together in the Ahiranya temple, where Malini is imprisoned for her traitorous crimes, and Priya is charged with watching over her. But Priya is no ordinary maidservant. Once a temple child, her people’s language was stolen, their culture abandoned, and they were left to starve. Priya doesn’t speak of her past, or the powers she holds as a result. While others, including her brother Ashok, are seeking rebellion against their oppressors, Priya’s view is complex to match the world she lives in. <br />In amongst a twisting tale of Malini’s attempts to escape, a sapphic romance develops between the two women. Told with evocative language, insightful layers are revealed of the two characters, as they explore their feelings in a relationship that holds huge significance for how they see the world. Two strong and complex women from the outset, it’s a relationship that builds trust, resilience and independent clarity, with character development as unpredictable as the world they live in. While Priya considers Malini has different faces to survive, Malini is steadfast in her thoughts of marriage: “What is more monstrous than that that is inherently by your nature unable to serve your purpose? To want simply because you want. To love simply for the sake of love.”<br /> I enjoyed this feminist perspective, and the magic that surrounded it. Priya has knowledge of the deathless waters, knowledge that could be used to aid the rebels. But with cool, calm scrutiny she makes choice decisions about who to trust and where her loyalties lie. Political tension mounts, as a cast of characters seek to determine their positions in a morally grey arena, and loyalties are tested and corruption is revealed, even among the closest of familial ties. Multiple voices add huge depth to the world, opening out geographical and magical dimensions, although at times I felt it detracted from the pace of the story and from the perspectives of Priya and Malini. Having said that, the depth of the world was a triumph, one unafraid of tackling issues of independence and empire pertinent to the world as we know it. It’s a question Priya and Malini must face, from opposite sides. For Priya, no matter what favours might be afforded, independence does not come still chained to the empire. <br />"

This book didn’t feel hard to get into despite the many POVs. It created this expansive and interwoven story that I couldn’t help thinking about even when I wasn’t reading. I normally don’t like books that have so many POVs right off the bat but this was very well done. Every POV was intentional and added to the plot. <br /><br />The characters each feel distinct though in some ways a little distant. In my opinion, the author relied heavily on characters and the setting being more mysterious than truly fleshed out in some senses. There was just a little bit of something missing there for me, barely, but noticeable all the same. However, I still really like each character and had a general sense of them and the setting. I wish the writing was a bit more visually descriptive, but the plot was so intriguing I barely noticed.<br /><br />The SE Asian and queer rep is SO well done. Malini and Priya feel like great sapphic rep. Their dynamic is tense and complicated. There’s this familiarity and otherness that is contrasted in both their situation and personalities. There is so much history, culture, and religion weaved through this story and romance. I don’t know how else to describe it other than in the same way one would describe a good cake: rich. <br /><br />Absolutely would recommend this book!"

It's about a captive princess and a maidservant become unlikely allies where they go on a journey to save their kingdom. I enjoyed the writing in this book, especially with the world-building. I love how it was easy to understand with vivid descriptives of what world the characters live in. I enjoyed the culture of India mixed into this book because I felt connected to the story at a personal level. I also thought that the pacing was great, the plot structure was well done but I did have a problem with the number of different PoVs. I think the author should have stuck with the main two character's PoV and should have left the side characters as I felt they weren't really needed. Overall the writing was really beautiful and something I haven't read before.<br /><br />I enjoyed the main characters, Malina and Priya a lot as they showed so much women representation. Priya is the maidservant that has forbidden power and Malini is the prison where her brother is forcing her to drink poison. They were both morally grey characters that are strong and would do anything to save their empire. I enjoyed how they grew in the story as they had good character development. Also, the side characters were well done and I enjoyed pretty much all of them. The romance is enemies to lovers trope between the lesbian characters. I wish there was more romance as there was only a little but I hope to see more of it in the next book.<br /><br />I enjoyed the ending of the book but I also felt that the story dragged a little. Not much but a little where I thought it could have been shortened. I had a few minor problems with this book but it was really close to a 5/5 star read. I'm really excited to read the next book just to see where the story will go next and more romance between Priya and Malina. I really recommend reading this book as it's a diverse book with Indian culture written by a POC book. I recommend this to fans of City of Brass and The Poppy War. "

As it progressed, I did eventually start rooting for the relationship and the two FMCs, I enjoyed the complexity of their relationship. The writing throughout is beautiful and very easy to read and digest.<br /><br />While the characters were likable, I didn't find myself particularly attached to any of them and the side characters were just *meh*. But more importantly I think the pacing of this book was a little off, it started out as a political drama and ended with magic. These two could have been more seamlessly woven together to make a cohesive narrative with a clear vision. Because of this disconnect, I think some readers will DNF fairly early on and those that make it to the end might not get what they were hoping for.<br /><br />Unlike Priory of the Orange Tree, I do think this book was true to marketing. This is a real Sapphic romance, I love the representation and contrast to social values and taboos within this world the author created."

      "review": "This was a fantastic read. I had actually been anticipating this book ever since I read the description, but it far surpassed my expectations. First, the world building was great. I loved learning about the country of Parajadvipa and the multiple complicated religions and philosophies that guided the people and the directed central conflict. Of course, it was especially exciting to discover the secrets of the Ahiranyan faith and ultimately learn what the deathly waters are, and the creatures behind them. I also really appreciated how the author utilized aspects of existing religions/philosophies - sometimes, seeing them in a totally different context changes the way you perceive them. With my heritage/religious background, I had grown up with and accepted the idea of fire as purifying and holy, but this text made me reflect on that meaning. <br /><br />Second, I really enjoyed the main characters. Priya is a very sympathetic and realistic character, grappling with the desire for self-actualisation, duty to country, and duty to her family. I think it was a nice touch that giving in to her selfish desires is what really helped her recover herself. Both in the context of the fictional society in this book as well as in real life, women are praised for selflessness, for suffering for the sake of others, and it was nice to see this trope turned around. Malini was a little harder to warm up to at first, but as the book progresses, it becomes easier to understand her knife-like sharpness, her duplicity, her thirst for power and concern of being drawn too far. She has suffered so much at the hands of monsters, but she consciously seeks to turn herself into one because she thinks it’s the only way to survive. While the book’s focus isn’t really romance, Malini and Priya’s relationship is perhaps the most important in the book (and that is saying something, given the large cast), and it was exciting to watch their relationship develop and grow, despite the setbacks they faced. Additionally, I found the parallels between Ashok, Priya’s brother, and Chandra + Aditya, Malini’s brothers very interesting. <br /><br />Next, I must compliment the plot. I was wearing a heartbeat tracker while reading this, and at multiple instances, I received a notification about “elevated HR at rest.” While the real action takes a while to develop, what comes before is also very engaging. Importantly, the most action heavy parts were tightly plotted and really kept me at the edge of my seat. There’s a definite slowdown in the last 15% of the book which can come across as a little jarring after so much action right before, but I think it was necessary to set up the sequel.<br /><br />I alluded to some of it earlier, but I really enjoyed how the author explored themes of family, fate, religion, nationalism, and especially the role of women. In the story, despite being relegated to the sidelines, diminished and ignored for their gender, they’re the catalyst for most of the book. Chandra’s ideal of a passive, “womanly” woman, and his way of robbing women of their agency by sacrificing them to the pyre is contrasted heavily with the many active women in the story. Indeed, even the original mothers, venerated only for their sacrifice, had agency. <br /><br />Lastly, I have to comment on the author’s choice to heavily draw upon and incorporate aspects of South Asian culture. I knew coming in, that this would happen, and it was one of the things that excited me about it initially, but it ended up meaning far, far more to me than I expected. I didn’t realize how nice it would feel to read a compelling sapphic fantasy in which names like my own are the norm, where the food, style of dress, and other cultural elements that are normally regarded as “exotic” or “ethnic,” are so casually mentioned. It’s challenging to feel like an outlier in both of the communities that you belong to, and this novel gave me a wonderful escape in a way that only fantasy can really provide."

      "review": "I've heard so much good about this book so I figured it had to be a success, right? Well… it IS good, especially for being a high fantasy YA starring a lesbian romance, but… wow, it was SO boring to read… it might just be me, because I had several things that didn't agree with me. Foremost I'm fed up with books where they burn women. If you don't like feministic tales where women are supressed and have no value other than carrying babies or being burnt as a sacrifice - then this is not a good book. <br /><br />If I look past the burning of women - which took a couple of hundred pages - there's a lot to like as well as dislike. First of all, this is really well written, which as I mentioned before, is rather unusual for the genre. On top of having a lesbian romance, Jasmine Throne takes place in a fantasy world not based on the typical western inspired fantasy setting, but an Indian one. It's still uncommon enough to be a new kind of experience for me. However, there was something with the writing that made it hard for me to get invested. Perhaps that the perspective changes so much in the beginning that it's hard to grow attached to the characters? Perhaps that the romance didn't feel like falling in love? Perhaps that nothing in the book was especially surprising? Perhaps that the antagonist felt unhinged, but not like he had any own motives or anything? Perhaps I simply couldn't see past the sexism and homophobia? Even though the only romance is between two women, homosexuality is frowned upon as something they used to do in Ahiranya, and it is perverse. SIGH. <br /><br />Concerning sexism and homophobia, Jasmine Throne does some of the things I hate most. Yet it manages to have a plentiful gallery with strong women, and I admit I'm impressed, because they all feel genuine. Even the homophobia isn't that much in your face, it's just a fact, and Priya shows us early on that she's not ashamed of liking girls. <br /><br />I'm a bit sad that I couldn't enjoy this book more, but I'm glad that it exists. I hope they'll stop their religious burning of women in the next book!"

It all boiled down to one word: subservient. In The Jasmine Throne, three women drive the narrative: an exiled princess, a maid-servant, and a noble lady. Three women who have survived and built their strengths in a world that expects them to disappear. This woman-centric Indian fantasy is all my heart has yearned for.<br /><br />The book opens with Malini’s heart sisters’ burning and her refusal to burn alongside them. Fire is a recurring theme in this book wherein the fires purify a woman who burns. Because she refused to burn and planned to depose her brother, Emperor Chandra, Malini is exiled to the Hirana, which once housed temple children, people with powers unseen. There, she lives her days under the influence of poison and stories of fire—a slow, torturous way of taking away Malini’s independence and control. However, despite her weakening state, she remains a calculative and shrewd bargainer.<br /><br />At the Hirana, Malini meets the once temple child, Priya, who accidentally reveals her nature. She is made a reluctant ally in exchange for Ahiranya’s freedom. Although this book was promoted as “morally grey lesbians,” I would be unwilling to call Priya a morally grey character. Rather, Priya is full of compassion and kindness. Her refusal to play into Malini’s hands and her eventual agreement were because she could not bear the princess’ suffering.<br /><br />This book is about the power women yield in the shadows, the way they carry their rage, nurturing it and weaving through the men’s politics with grace. None of our main characters is well-adjusted, likable people. None of these women is guided by a moral code; Lady Bhumika, the Ahiranyi wife of the Parijati regent, is my favourite. She plays the role of a “good wife” while tightening the weaves on her own goals. Unlike Priya, her morality stands behind Ahiranya’s freedom. Morality and hurt circle these women as they fight the horrors of their past, stare hollow futures in the eyes and refuse it all.<br /><br /><b>\n   A FAMILIAR AND INTIMATE WORLDBUILDING \n</b><br /><br />Many reviews have described the worldbuilding as interesting, lush, and so on, but, to me, it is a familiar comfort. The temple description, the food, the clothes and even the minor details of how characters behaved reminded me so much of home.<br /><br />Each scene was intimate and rich. The magic system was unlike any I’ve read. In this book, magic is connected to spiritual waters, unspoken names, prophecies, and nature itself. It is alive; in The Jasmine Throne, magic is earned. It requires surrender before it can be wielded. The intensity of this system brings it alive. Whether it is the immersion in spirit waters or the deciphering of the stars, every symbol is intentional.<br /><br /><b>\n   THE PUSH AND PULL OF CHARACTER RELATIONSHIPS \n</b><br /><br />This book explores is the complicated relationship we have with family, especially those who hurt us. The push and pull of the characters as they seek power to take back what was lost, to dominate, to avenge, and to live freely. This book explores the lengths one goes through to gain that and the people they sacrifice along the way. The author presents us with neither good nor bad characters, like Lady Bhumika, who is forming her own resistance, or Rao, Malini’s ally and an Alori prince. Each character was so well-developed with agendas that often clashed. Yet when we read from their perspective, we understand why they pursue these goals single-mindedly.<br /><br />Another relationship that readers are sure to love is the budding romance between Priya and Malini. While it is incendiary, their romance does not take away from the central plot of the book. Rather it is a slow, trembling thing as they skirt between the desire to use each other and the slow blossoming of affection.<br /><br />This book does not shy away from the drama and tension. It explores power, and the play’s characters take at it. The Jasmine Throne is a book that burns away the pages of traditional Indian stories to reveal that women and their stories have always been there.<br /><br /><b>\n  <i>I have a booktube channel now!

      "review": "I am not going to rate the book, as I don't appreciate this popular author setting her followers on (admittedly rude) reviewers on twitter like dogs on a bear hunt. Less than 20 pages left after returning from my vacation and being informed of this whole drama, I still finished the read, but it left a bitter taste in my mouth and was a struggle to get through. This sort of behaviour killed all of my enjoyment of the story.<br /><br />I will say that <i>The Jasmine Throne</i> is still a great work of speculative fiction, albeit not on a par with Suri's standalones, in my opinion - the introspective, character-centered style just doesn't work as well in an epic fantasy story with high political stakes. While I loved especially Malini and Bhumika as characters, some other POVs seemed superfluous (at least two of them are one-chapter throwaway POVs told by a replaceable guard each, who both never get mentioned before or after again).<br /><br />Regardless of that, I do once again commend the author for an in-itself diverse fantastical universe built on South Asian cultures and for introducing LGBTQ+ representation in a (partly) queer-friendly worldbuilding. I am not entirely convinced of the chemistry between Priya and Malini, but that hairwashing scene? Exquisite yearning.<br /><br />My excitement has been tempered of course. There used to be a time when I couldn't even imagine sending a fan letter to a favourite author, but now that I've chatted with beloved writers or casually exchanged comments on social media, living the childhood dream, I can also say that a healthy, professional distance would perhaps be the best kind of publicity for some of them. I've seen around a dozen authors migrate to instagram (and tiktok) in the past few weeks, and now I see how that might be a good idea.<br /><br />I'm going to keep the review short and let the booktwitter discourse stew for a while before I decide how I truly felt about this novel or if I even want to continue the series. Personally, I still don't know where exactly I stand in this predicament as a creator in my own right - just that I don't want to be impartial in this case."

It took me a while to really get into it but I think I just didn't read it at the right time. <br /><br />Looking back, I enjoyed so much about this story: the characters are fleshed out, the plot is compelling, the world building is not info-dumpy, I love that we have three women at the center of the action that react like real women, and I enjoyed the queer romance.<br /><br />So clearly, I liked a lot about this book. My major issue is with the way things happened. I could see what the author was doing most of the time and it was taking me out of the story. A lot was relaying on coincidences and reactions that I did not always understand, especially with Ashok. <br /><br />I will try and read the second book, see if that one might work better for me."

      "review": "<i>There is power that is showy and fierce. And there is power grown slowly, and stronger for the time spent braiding its ancient strength.</i><br /><br />Rating: Alright, 2.5 stars rounded to 3.<br /><br />This was a second chance reading for me. I had previously gotten about halfway through in March 2022 and DNFd it. I had heard so many glowing reviews though, I was curious what I'd think if I revisited it. I had previously been under a lot of stress and didn't love the audiobook narration, so I figured I'd give it another go. I'm not mad that I did so, but my opinions didn't really change much, and I probably could have gone with my original instinct to DNF. <br /><br />I think that the worldbuilding in this book is incredible. It has some of the most intriguing plant-based magic. I feel like it explores this in a very unique way. There is a disease called the Rot, which is basically turning people into plants over time, and those who are blessed by the Deathless Waters are able to have some measure of control over plants and foliage. There are some indications of gods in this world - there are some interactions with them, but they are still pretty mysterious by the end of the book. <br /><br />The themes that this book explores are some of my favorite to examine in fantasy, especially colonialism, systems of power, and rebellion. I adored Bhumika. She was easily my favorite character. I felt like she had the most compelling storyline and really appreciated how she cultivated her power in a very unassuming way but ended up being the one that others ended up rallying around by the end. She was morally on the gray side, but it was very clear what her values were and I felt she was one of the only characters whose actions and what we saw from them lined up fully with what we were told. Priya was similar to some extent, but I felt like there was still quite a bit of being told that she is a bad ass and that she was actually a softie, but I just didn't see that as much. <br /><br />Where things ended up falling apart for me was really on the other characters. I don't think that we are meant to really like any of the MCs, but it was honestly kind of hard to tell if that was the intention or not. I fell like we are constantly told that Malini is super persuasive, very politically adept, and a super cunning strategist. I didn't really see much of that. Some of that could be due to the circumstances she found herself in for most of the novel (a prisoner), but even towards the end when we were supposed to see her coming into her own, I just felt like we were repeatedly being told these things rather than actually being able to observe them for myself. Similar with Ashok - he was set up as sort of a villainous perspective, but we are just told how dangerous he is, and really it didn't feel like it added up to anything substantial. <br /><br />I also didn't really buy into any of the relationships between the characters. The one that felt the most realistic was Rukh and Priya's friendship, and I could buy that Ashok and Bhumika were siblings, but honestly beyond that, I just didn't buy most of the relationships. I thrive on character relations to each other, so this was a big issue for me. I would be okay with it if it was a very fast-paced book with a really intriguing plot. But it's definitely not that. It is a very slow-paced plot with a lot of time spent sitting with the characters and their issues, so to me that means that these characters should be really well-fleshed out. <br /><br />I think that the character relationship that is most unbelievable to me is Priya and Malini's. I feel like this is the relationship that the most weight is placed on, and it is the one that is being set up to drive forward a lot of the plot of this series. It is pitched as a very slow burn romance; however, I don't see any of the burn, and it doesn't feel slow at all. It feels like they skipped over a few steps and went straight to the insta-love. I honestly don't understand why the two women are so into each other and say things like they know every part of the other. If they were connected in a purely physical level and just lusting after each other, that would be totally fine and make much more sense to me. But talking about personality? I don't get it at all. Legitimately 90% of their relationship seems to have been spent with one basically comatose with almost no substantive interactions. If we were meant to think that Priya was viewing Malini as one of her charity cases and that she had a lot of protective feelings towards her because of that, I would buy that. I do not buy that she is in love with her. I feel like we jumped really quickly from nurse/patient to lovers with almost nothing inbetween. It feels veeeeery insta-lovey to me. My issue is that they are talking about love and talking about how they'll find each other no matter how many years go by. I was rolling my eyes a lot, and that's mainly because I feel like their entire relationship is telling not showing. I am much more interested in Priya and Bhumika's relationship and would rather have spent time exploring their sibling dynamic. <br /><br />I feel like that relationship is what is being set up as a driving factor for the rest of the series. And not buying into it just makes me wonder if it is even worth it to read the next one. Honestly the world is what keeps this at a 2.5/3, rather than dipping lower. Worldbuilding and magic are 5 star, absolutely loved it level. However, the characters and pacing are down at the meh, 2 star level, or 1.5 stars, not for me. I am still super intrigued by the world though and want to know what happens next. So I'm not sure if I'll continue and see if I like the Oleander Sword more. We shall see!<br /><br />I know this definitely feels more negative than positive, but I do want to say that if the characters work for you, I think you will love this story. Because they don't work for me, it really pulled me out of the beautiful world that the author built. <br />"

      "review": "2.5 stars but rounding down because oh lord this was so boring to begin with. I have a cold and I'm crabby so I think I might be a bit more charitable at another time, but maybe not - with all the weirdness of climbing up towers I kept flashing back to <i>Tangled</i>'s 'Rapunzel, let down your haaa-iiir', and it was always going to be a problem. <br /><br />That's actually beside the point though, because I liked the whatever little that is explained of Ahiranya's magic. The yakshas are definitely manipulative, I wonder if there's anyone left who knows what it really means to pass through the deathless waters three times. I'm sure they're in for a rude awakening in the second book. I can't also be the only one who thought this kind of similar to whatever Brandon Sanderson set up in <i>The Stormlight Archive</i>. But, looking at other reviews, maybe I am.<br /><br />That was another problem. I thought most of it was derivative, one way or another. I understand that there's not a truly new story, but I also don't want to constantly think of other books - I mean Malini with her Mother of Flames speech was pure Dany, and I really hate Dany. There weren't even dragons this time, so there's no excuse. Priya's manipulation of vines and roots reminded me of Tangled and Rapunzel's hair manipulation multiple times - I'd have rather watched Tangled.<br /><br />Just giving people power who don't know what to do with it doesn't really work either. I like research, but Priya makes it her job to forget things until the plot requires her to remember, and then she closes her eyes and does, magically. Telling me that Malini can command people because she's manipulative and then showing me that she couldn't even manipulate Priya doesn't work either. Especially since Priya is so dim she feels betrayed by Malini (seriously not even a day passes before Malini sees Priya do magic and she requests this particular maid to do for her at all times). But true love or whatever I guess? Their romance didn't convince me and I usually don't really care much unless I have to set aside the book to puke - this didn't make me puke but it was the definition of whatever. They could have existed without having been a couple. <br /><br />I'm a little inordinately irritated by the nameless Prince Rao (why Rao - it literally is king, not that there haven't been kings called Raja Raja or some nonsense, but it's redundant, especially when you're choosing for yourself). Not his character, although his character bugs me a little also, but the fact that his name is such a mystery and that he held on closely to a prophecy until it could make a difference. I mean, maybe speak of it to others so they could have started off supporting Malini instead of needlessly leading them all to this reluctant guy who abdicated the throne while knowing what kind of a man he was leaving the throne to. <br /><br />I listened to the audiobook, so it bugged me I couldn't figure out where Parijatdvipa was in relation to Ahiranya. Dvipa is an island. Is Parijat island supposed to Britain? I don't even want to think about the connotations if that's the case. Why Ahiranya? Hiranya is made of gold, Ahiranya as far I can follow Sanskrit conjugations, will amount to not made of gold. That's a rather sad name to give yourself. The names of the people are mostly modern sounding to my Indian self (there are ways to backdate these very names but that wasn't done) and that was just one more thing that brought me forcibly out of the world. Props though that the author avoided any mention of traditional Hindu gods, she doesn't say whom the priests pray to, whom the temple is for. This also means that the magic system is super vague and the power is all woo-woo nonsense, but I would have been even more irritated had I had to be offended on behalf my religion when I really have no wish to. <br /><br />I have no idea if I will read book 2. There were multiple things I didn't like about the book, and it was slow. And I also didn't think any of the characters, except maybe Bhumika, are people I want to spend time with. However, I have low standards and this one didn't actively offend me - Malini and Priya are tolerable together even if they're not people I'd go to bat for, and no religion. That last one is actually what would have driven me crazy, plus I do want to see if Ahiranya is actually going to regret giving power to yaksa. So, maybe I'll read it when the third one is out. "

It took me a while to get into it and finish. Let me tell y'all!!!! I fell in love with the people, the cultures, the food, the language, the writing, oh goddess, help me, the writing is SUPERB!!<br /><br />Our MCs are Princess Malini from Parijatdvipa and Priya from Ahiranya, and they have the slowest of slow burns romance that I want to fight this author on this, but I also would not have her change a thing, but we still fight. <br /><br />We meet Malini as a prisoner in the Hirana (I did tell you I was in love with the language here, didn't I anyway). The Hirana is an ancient cliffside temple that was once the revered source of the magical deathless waters but is now little more than a decaying ruin with a very dark not-so-past. <br /><br />Priya was born in the Hirana, she is one of the temple children, and the Hirana calls to Priya. I have such a deep passionate love for Priya, and I hope her gods do her justice, make her crazy powerful, and answer all her dreams (lol). When our two MCs meet... it is not love at first sight. Priya is working as a servant in the Hirana. She hates (and with great reason) the monarchy from Parijatdvipa. Malini is a prisoner, but she is still a symbol of all that the people of Ahiranya hate, and again it's with good reason. You can understand Priya's reluctance when they first meet.<br /><br />An accidental turn of events leads Malini to witness Priya's true nature as the child of the Hirana, and at that moment, their fate becomes intertwined. Maline wants her evil despotic brother to pay for everything he has put her through, not just her, but also for their people (Parijati) and the people of Ahiranya. And these two together are a force of nature. <br /><br />I love that both our MCs are strong women in their own right. However, every character in this book has depth. DEPTH I tell you! Big shout out to Lady Bhumika, her character; wow!!! Just wow! And the ending... I am working hard not to give spoilers, folks. <br /><br />I got this book, then brought it on audible. DO IT!! Audible helps with all the pronunciations I botched; secondly, it adds color to this picture; third, the narrator FITS this story. While this is the book review, I want to take a moment and give a deep bow to the narrator Shiromi Arserio! Excellent work! Give yourself a high five for me if you ever see this review. <br /><br />It is a heavy, heavy read, I am not sure I can read this book more than once, but it has lived in my mind rent-free since I finished it, so who wins here?! Looking forward to the second book (already pre-ordered, don't worry). <br /><br />I highly recommend this book/audiobook! This is fiction; if you want to know more about this book and what culture it closely mimics, remember this is fiction. With that said, I think it mimics Pakistani and Indian cultures to the best of my knowledge-- which admittedly is not reliable. "

Three young women have been destined to burn alive in honor of the Mothers of flame, except that one of them, the Emperor’s sister refuses to willingly climb onto the pyre to burn. The Jasmine Throne tells the story of Priya, a servant girl who ends up taking care of Malini, the princess who refused to sacrifice herself on the pyre. The storyline is filled with politics, violence (nothing too explicit), rebellious groups, magic and religious beliefs. There are also other POVs from rebel leaders and ruling lords of Ahiranyi.<br><br>Malini is full of conflicting emotions and internal turmoils, which was interesting to read, but the rest of her felt ordinary and I did not connect with her that much. Priya has mysterious magical abilities, and she was definitely more intriguing than Malani. I enjoyed getting to know her and her dark past. Priya and Malini’s chapters were interesting to read, but the other characters had minimal development, and I think I would have preferred this book to have only two POVs because I have to say that I was not particularly interested in the other characters.<br><br>It’s hard to further explain the plot of The Jasmine Throne because it honestly feels more like a long prequel. The majority of the book revolves around Malini escaping her prison, Priya’s brother trying to get her to work for him because he needs her magic abilities, and growing discontent and revolutionary ideas among the population. The author is very skilled and writes beautifully, but even so, I have to say that I am overall underwhelmed by this book. There are many great ideas, but I feel that there is still something missing and it prevented me from really getting into this story. Part of it is probably because I had trouble connecting with many characters who had their own chapters, but I think it’s also because of the slow pace and the whole plot that feels more like a setup for the second book than an adventure in itself. The point of this book is to get you ready for the main conflict that is to come in the second book. <br><br>The world-building is great and steady. There is a strong Indian influence, and the author does a great job of weaving the Indian culture into her fantasy world. There is no info-dump, but I have to say that since my electronic ARC didn’t have a map yet, it was hard to get a clear picture of the geography and to understand well the politics and tensions at first, but once you’re immersed in the story it all starts to make sense eventually.<br><br>The relationship between Priya and Malini is well written and developed enough to be realistic, but still, I did not like their dynamic or romance that much. I thought the whole romance part was lacking and even felt forced sometimes... Honestly, I wish they had just been friends instead. It is a medium burn, so at least there is no insta-love or insta-lust.<br><br>I would still recommend this book if you are a fan of Indian-inspired high fantasy with great world-building, a mix of politics and religion, and a medium burn sapphic romance.<br><br><img src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1638577013i/32270324._SX540_.jpg\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"><br>Fanart by Kim Ekdahl<br><br><br><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/lucie_v_booklover/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Follow me on Instagram</a> 🙂"

Its the type of book you really want to take your time with at the beginning, just so that you can fully grasp the vast empires, setting, religions, etc. I promise, its worth it.<br /><br />THE MAGIC SYSTEM took slightly longer for me to fully grasp, just because there were so many aspects to it but again, the author does an incredible job of slowly introducing us to everything so that there was never any major info-dumps. The magic in this was really unique, and I loved every little detail, especially surrounding the creeping rot and how religion tied in with the fantasy.<br /><br />ITS A DESI-INSPIRED EPIC FANTASY. And it was done perfectly. It was gorgeous and it felt so so nice to be able to read a fantasy where you recognize some of the foods, clothes, names, traditions and just wow. It still shocks me a little when I read these desi OwnVoices stories and feel represented and seen and just god I loved it. <br /><br />THE CHARACTERS were just so well written. There are a lot of different pov's from a massive cast of characters, and I somehow understood and could relate to them all in some way. There's a villain prince who I hated so much yet was so intrigued by? Each character had their own unique voice and compelling motives, which made the sudden shifts in storylines maintain a steady pace rather than slow it down. I really loved every single chapter. <br /><br />IT HAS AN ANGSTY ENEMIES-TO-LOVERS SAPPHIC SLOWBURN ROMANCE BETWEEN TWO MORALLY GRAY LESBIANS. And if that doesn't convince you to read it, I really don't know what will. <br /><br />If you're looking for a rich, Indian-inspired fantasy, written with a lush, compelling prose, ferocious desi characters looking to overrun the empire, a touching romance, and a captivating magic system, pick up The Jasmine Throne. I will forever love this book and cannot wait for the next installment."

      "review": "I cannot describe how GOOD this book was for me. This book was amazing, the writing and the charectors were very well done. But the thing which robbed this book of five stars were -<br /><br />a) the multiple POVS<br />At one point I was so frustrated. Like WHO TF IS MITHUNAN? JITHESH? Wtf<br /><br />Random charectors and their cameo gets yeeted in out of nowhere. NOWHERE. But these are kinda significant to the plot so you have to read it. Tbh I wanted to THROW the book against a damn wall<br /><br />b) Tension who?<br />Like the tension between Priya and Malini was kinda non existent. The waterfall-kiss scene had like *the bare minimum* tension build up<br />But after the waterfall scene things started to kick in, with the knife to the ribs and more kissing scenes but again, NOT ENOUGH GAY PANICK. OR TENSION.<br /><br />c) Not enough gay panick -<br />Priya does have gay panick but Malini? None. <br />My gaydar wasn't picking anything up from her. At all. Not even a bit occupied bi shit. So when Malini kissed pri, the thought it was like manipulation since she's described as manipulative and cunning and whantnot. (She kinda is)<br />I mean, they are trynna save their culture/ancient magic religion and country from literally burning in/from misogyny so I'd give that a pass <br /><br />Overall review is 4.4 stars. Five stars felt a bit too generous<br /><br />Anyway I think the author was going for Sati with the burning mothers and parijatdvipada but like, it felt less misogynistic. If she'd went with Sati it would have been better<br /><br />And some words were directly hindi-translated so as a Hindi speaking gal, it was kinda funny<br /><br />Pros-<br /><br />• Really good charectors<br />•Writing chefs kiss<br />• You can smell the misogyny and feminism<br />• Fantastic World<br />•Well written povs, to the point and not lengthy<br />• Even tho zero build up, good romance<br />• Knives. Women with knives<br /><br /><br />Overall really amazing read. Few drawbacks but finally a well-done wlw/sapphic fantasy.<br /><br />And it ends in cliffhanger. Yay"

      "review": "This is an India-inspired epic fantasy with a side wlw romance. This was amazing. There was extremely complex worldbuilding and mythology and I really enjoyed piecing together people's political alliances and connections and the history and the myth of the world. Each city-state was developed in detail, with its own history, religion, culture, politics and language. <br /><br />Characterization was very well done. This author is fantastic at nuanced and complex portrayals of characters, and there was such a wide range of personalities. I loved that characters were often not what they seemed. You might get a POV chapter from Bhumika's husband where he thinks she's soft-hearted and meek, but when Bhumika's chapter comes along, it's revealed that she's been cultivating that image to fool her husband. I also appreciated that there was no true 'villain' in the main cast, except Chandra and Vikram. Each character has their own distinct motivations and goals. I especially liked Priya and Bhumika and their relationship. <br /><br />The book really shines when it's focused on politics, worldbuilding and myth, and intimate character studies. On the other hand, I felt that the pacing of the novel was rather uneven. The first 50% was mainly worldbuilding. Although nothing much happened and it felt rather slow, I was intrigued enough by the world itself to keep reading. Around the midpoint of the book, the rebellion starts and the book really starts to move. A more action-focused plot fills the second half of the book but unfortunately I felt that the action scenes didn't really draw me in. I felt like a lot of the action was 'told' instead of shown, and there was a lot of POV changing which broke the flow. In the last few chapters, we finally get some answers and plot-twists and that was really fun to read.<br /><br />Another note is that there were a number of POVs. I liked most of the narrators, but some of the POVs could have been cut - the character only appeared once or twice and never again, and not including them won't have made much difference to the plot.<br /><br />I also really loved the novel's social commentary. The author touches on feminism/gender inequality/misogyny, imperialism, religion and faith and many others. The portrayal of misogyny and feminism was especially powerful, with many of the experiences of the female characters easily paralleling real-world situations and societies, making really pointed or poignant comments about the way women are treated. It was a real treat to read about resourceful, cunning, and complex women."

      "review": "Take a shot every time you read \"profusion\" or \"kneeled.\" <br /><br />PROS: <br /> - Magic integration into the world, characters, and plot.<br /> - Power was not inherently good or bad, the Yaska had an appropriately weighty presence. The magic system was interesting and unique.<br /> - Representation made for a nice change of pace in the epic fantasy genre, of, for example, women as lead characters in positions of power, non-straight people, not the typical European setting.<br /> - Prose was pretty at points.<br /> - Audiobook narrator.<br /><br />CONS: <br /> - Blunt in its messages and maneuvering. So much subtlety was spelled out as if the reader couldn't read between the lines.<br /> - Rigid, simplified perspectives with close-minded characters that were unwilling to discuss or compromise their beliefs, even in the face of a situation turning against them, even when conversing with their closest friends and relatives. <br /> - Overdramatic and self-serious. Not once did I laugh in amusement… no humor… 533 pages and no humor… <br /> - Wasn't feeling the romance / chemistry between Priya and Malini.<br /> - The jailbreak arc took so long, &gt;60%, as did Priya in doing what she went to the Hirana to do. Pace picked up after they escaped.<br /> - Suspension of belief needed to make the characters as X as they claimed, be it grand, wise, smart, cruel, politically devious, badass, what have you. The politics felt unrealistic, I wasn't a fan of Priya's \"edgy dark past traumatized badass\" characterization (why did Temple children need to learn fighting/killing, anyway, when their main opponent was what lay in the deathless waters?), Ashok being the leader of the rebellion felt undeserved (there were two instances of leaders giving kill orders and then leaving and having an underling carry out the sentence, which was behavior that felt incongruous to the roles these characters were meant to portray). The author also wrote so many appealing sounding sentences, as if bolstering her story with this would compensate for the lack of examples of how generally epic everyone and everything was supposed to be. <br /> - Any messages built off the parallels between the sibling dynamics of Malini/Chandra and Priya/Ashok didn't outweigh the repetitiveness.<br /> - The characters generally felt like they thought similarly. That is not to say that their beliefs were similar, just their cognition and reasoning gave off a similar feel. They didn't feel like different people.<br /><br />OVERALL: A profusion of elements that would theoretically create something amazing, and yet they didn't. This book did not make me feel anything, except for annoyed and bored. 2/5."

      "review": "<b>“Power can be looking after people. Keeping them safe, instead of putting them into danger.”</b><br /><br />5/5 stars (This had a 4.5 star but NO WAY. This IS a 5 star)<br /><br /><b>Trigger warnings:</b> gender based violence, homophobia, abusive family member, body horror, child murder, violence, body horror, self mutilation, suicide ideation, forced drug use. <br /><br /><b>The Jamine Throne</b> was such an amazing book, right from the start. Delving into themes like <b>religious extremism, symbolism &amp; sovereignty, imperialism, misogyny and homophobia</b>, its a promising start to the Burning Kingdoms trilogy and I cannot wait for the second book. Sadly, (although understandable) that will not be for another year, so I will have to settle with people reading this <i>masterpiece of a book</i>, so someone can talk to me about it. <s>And so that we may have more fanart</s><br /><br />After refusing to burn at the pyre, <b>Malini´s brother</b>, Chandra, exiles her to the Hirana, where she is isolated and drugged, no companion other than Pramila, her jailer, and the maidservants who clean her chambers every night. Among those maidservants is <b>Priya</b>, an <b>Ahiranyi</b> woman, who hides a deadly secret. <br /><br /><b>Priya</b> acceptes the job as the princess´ maidservant and, with the others, must risk her life everyday climbing the treacherous walls of the Hirana, where pilgrims once strived to reach both the elders of Ahiranyi and the <i>deathless waters.</i> Sadly and through terrible luck, Priya is attacked on the Hirana´s triveni, revealing her long kept secret to Malini, who wants nothing more than to escape and unseat her brother from the Throne. Together, they will carve themselves a place in the Empire and change it. <br /><br /><b>The Worldbuilding</b><br /><br />The Empire of <b>Parijatdvipa</b> is made up of various city states: Dwarali, Saketa, Ahiranya, Srugna and Alor as well as the capital city: Parijat. Each city state has its own leadership (with Ahiranya being ruled over by a regent) and on top of that is the Emperor and his advisors. The book centers mostly around Ahiranya, specially <b>Hiranaprastha</b>, where Malini spends most of her time imprisoned in the <b>Hirana, Ahiranya´s temple</b>. <br /><br /><b>Hiranaprastha</b> is perfectly crafted to give a sense of where the characters are, exactly: The Bazaar, the Pink Lantern district or the Hirana temple. Right from the start, there is a sense of what exactly is happening: A blight, a general repression of the population, unrest, lack of cultivation and trade, a different ideology and religion, a culture on the verge of disappearance. <br /><br />Personally, I think it´s simple, but quite effective. Unlike other books, there was no info dump and while I did struggle to grasp the world (as I do with most fantasies), most of my questions where answered at the end of the book. <br /><br /><b>The point of conflict</b><br /><br />As stated before, <b>Ahiranya</b> suffers from a blight called the Rot. I thought the idea was interesting and quite original. Throughout the story, the Rot serves a multitude of purposes, mainly highlighting <i>prejudice</i>. Empire people fear the sickness and although The Rot is not contagious, people still prefer to steer clear of infected people. <br /><br />The Rot is also believed to have been originated when the temple children got more powerful, representing conflict between the Elders, The Empire and the children who suffered for a belief. <br /><br />While I think it was a point fairly developed (the symptoms, how if affects people, either infected or not, the general outcome and the belief of it) I believe it could have done with a stronger explanation on its origin. <br /><br /><b>\"Some men dream of times long dead, and times that never existed, and they're willing to tear the world apart entirely to get them.” </b><br /><br /><b>The Narration</b><br /><br />The story is told through four main POVS, the rest of them (personally, for me) being complementary. I´m not a fan of multiple POVS. To be fair though, I loved the fact that the chapters (and therefore, the complementary POVS) where short. While I don´t think this book could have done well with a solo POV, I do believe it could have been done with less than 5 POVS but again, that is just me.<br /><br /><b> The characters</b> (in order from I love you to I despise you)<br /><br />I loved loved loved Priya with all my heart. She is so soft, fierce, loyal and brave and desperately wants to do what is right, even if it means \"condemning\" other people for it. I loved the perspective she put into play. <b>Priya</b> is <b>Ahiranyi</b> first and foremost. That means that, like the rest of her people, she has struggled in a place where <b>Parijati</b> people have been deemed superior: all power and political posts delegated to them. She has seen children suffer from the Rot and has experienced what it is like to be left alone and vulnerable in a place that condemns her for who she is. She has every right to be angry. Still, she (very much unlike <b>Ashok</b>) knows that while there is a price to pay for everything, that price doesn´t need to be high on violence or death. <br /><br /><b>Bhumika</b> (my second favorite top tier character, thanks) is admirable. She is judged time and time again for being <b>Ahiranyi</b> (specially by Priya) and marrying the land´s regent. For carrying his child. For feeling something towards him and for staying in the safety of the mahal, trying to help as much orphans as she can. She wants safety and she knows that she probably wouldn´t be able to do much outside of the place she already carved for herself. She is strong willed and cunning, so so smart and strong. I mean, I was speechless at the end. <br /><br />Honestly, Priya and Bhumika for the win.<br /><br /><b>Malini</b> wasn´t particularly my favorite character but she is still incredible. Resilient and strong and manipulative. I love it. It´s hard to come across these types of characters. She is unashamedly herself. She sees Priya as an opportunity for survival and escape, and takes it time and time again: in the Hirana, on the forest, on the camps. She is willing to sacrifice for what she believes is right and still manages to have that human side of her, that <i>fear</i> that she will be somehow unrecognizable by the end of it all. <br /><br />Finally, on Malini´s character, I love that she has no idea how to fight: no sword, no dagger, not even fists. Many times the definition of \"strong woman\" is seen as a woman who wields a sword. I understand why. It´s the very antithesis of what women were permitted to do. It´s easy to fall into that mindset. Nevertheless, I like that the book <b>highlights</b> different kinds of strength in each of its characters. <b>Priya</b> wields the sword, but is not magically powerful ( a la Mary Sue). <b>Bhumika</b> has one of the strongest wills and <b>Malini</b> is smart and cunning. Utter perfection. <br /><br /><b>Rao and Prem</b> were a bit forgettable to me, (besides the fact that they wanted a pact with the regent and to save Malini) but I like the dynamics that were presented between <b>Malini</b> and them (specially the camp scene). I´m sure that they are going to play a larger role in the next books, as it was stated that most of the armies are stationed in Dwarali and Srugna.<br /><br />I don´t like <b>Ashok</b> at all, but I understand the struggle he was in. As Priya, he has every right to be angry, to want his culture and his language and his freedom back. He is just searching for a way, and I understand that. He is right, in a small way, but unlike Bhumika or Priya, he is willing to pay any price and (my opinion) that is dangerous, and places you in a line that is easily crossed. (Much like Baru Cormorant, in that sense) Unlike Bhumika or Priya, he did not ask himself the costs, the alternatives or even the aftermath of a bloody war, which he was willing to create.<br /><br /><b>Pramila</b> I do not like her, but at the same time I feel for her. I think, in another world, her and Malini could have forgiven each other, but grief (very much understandable) made her cruel to the point in which she almost murdered someone utterly outside the problem at hand. I still hope we somehow see her come to terms with what happened, at least in a small way. <br /><br /><b>Vikram</b>. I despise Vikram with all my heart, but hell, not as much as Santosh, because he is off the charts here. (To be fair though, from this point onward, I just...) This man is terrible. Awful. He is obviously under Chandra´s thumb the whole time. He has an obligation to fulfill and a position to keep, but he is <i>atrocious</i>. He is married to an <b>Ahiranyi</b> woman, despite the fact that he treats and thinks of them as dogs, murders her people crushing their skulls and burning them... I- Let´s not talk about the fact that the only trace of humanity he shows to the people is just after <b>Santosh</b> destroys their houses and not as an act of compassion, but again, as a way of thinking of them as snapping dogs. I just, ugh. I´m just surprised <b>Bhumika</b> even managed to put up with him for such a long time. <br /><br /><b>Santosh</b>. Sir, I´m sorry (not really though) but there is not even a redeeming quality about you. He is the very definition of a supremacist, a narcissist, cruel, boot-licking ugh. Sadly he was necessary to make a contrast between him and Vikram. Shit happens. <input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"spoiler__control\" aria-label=\"The following text has been marked spoiler.

He is an extraordinary villain. An extremist, willing to put his sister to death. Instilling fear on people, and ultimately being the one in charge of the context: the burnings, the houses being destroyed, the politicians and advisors losing their places only for crueler people to rise in their places. I seriously cannot wait for what he is going to bring in book two. <br /><br />At the end of the day, these characters were amazing and, while I think some of them need more depth, I have no doubt they will get a chance to shine in the next books. <br /><br /> <b>The plot and pacing</b><br /><br />Despite this being a monster of a book. I finished it in 3 days. I´m actually really surprised and this is on the book, not me. I´m a slow reader. It was gripping. It had amazing writing. It was perfectly balanced: no info dumps, short chapters, plot clicking with worldbuilding clicking with romance. Just *chef´s kiss* It was such an easy read, to be a fantasy. <b>THE SKILL</b><br /><br /> <b>The romance</b><br /><br />Oh. I knew I was in for it. When I tell you I screamed. I loved their meeting and the banter between them. I am, for some reason, weak at characters doing little things for each other like washing each others hair, (or blow drying it, ahem *Warden*) telling each other stories, etc. I. CANNOT. DEAL. WITH. IT. The yearning, the looks, ugh and that waterfall scene had me happy dancing. Still, I like that the romance did not get in the way of any of the character´s goals. Priya went to the temple and became an elder, like she needed. Malini stayed at camp in order to finish the job she had started before she was sent to the Hirana. <br /><br />I liked the themes the romance brought into play (the insecurities, the fear). In The Empire, romance between the same sex is deemed as \"impure\".Priya had a completely different mindset than that of Malini´s and it´s actually heartbreaking to see what Priya tells Malini after their first kiss. ( <i>\"You know this doesn´t make you a monster\"</i>) I hurt for Malini, especially because she had to hide who she was to her loved ones, to her family. Status: heart broken.<br /><br /><b>The themes</b><br /><br />-Imperialism.<br />-How best a country can be recognized as \"independent\"? (i.e. symbolism)<br />-How to give other countries the impression that your country is strong enough to maintain its own sovereignty.<br />-Being a woman in a patriarchal society, where playing politics, ruling and fighting are something you have no right to and yet men take it for granted (Aditya)<br />-Carving yourself a place where society doesn´t deem you \"fit\" to belong (Malini as Empress)<br />-The way certain words are used as a weight, specially for women. (i.e: monstrous and the context in which it is used)<br />-Extremism in how Chandra burned and crushed people to death. <br />-Homophobia.<br /><br /><b>The ending</b><br /><br />I just have a bad feeling about the next book. It wasn´t a cliff hanger, per se. I loved the choice to go with Chandra´s POV. Its actually chilling and fascinating to be inside his head after shaping him and characterizing him from other character´s heads. I have a lot of questions I´m going to need answers to, and I´m already waiting impatiently for the next book. <br /><br />Honestly, I cannot recommend this book enough. <br /><br /><b>\"There is no meaning in the universe: no fate, no high blood, no rights of kings over land. Everything is emptiness. The world only had meaning when we give it meaning.\"</b>"

      "review": "It's not everyday I get to read a book with an inspired world based on a lesser used culture, and for that I'm grateful. But let me preface this review by saying that I didn't enjoy this book all that much, and I'm disappointed.<br /><br />I have <a href=\"http://www.daysinotherworlds.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">my own blog</a> now, so please do give it a visit if you're interested in my other reviews :)<br /><br />──────────────────<br /><br />I believe that I came into this one with higher than needed expectations, not because I consider it bad, not really, but more so because almost all of its marketed elements are things I really enjoy and it was hard not to. But ultimately, I am a little more on the disappointed side than not. <br /><br />When I come into a world that is interesting, based on a culture I don't see often and is threaded with an intriguing magical ability, I get incredibly excited and hope that the focus will be on expanding those things before I begin to move to anything else. In <i>The Jasmine Throne</i> however, in my humble opinion, that expansion was secondary to the building of the relationship between the two main characters as until chapter 40 out of the 70 (chapter 46 in particular had the first big info dump I needed), many of the things frequently mentioned in the series were just that, frequently mentioned. <br /><br />I didn't know exactly why what happened to the temple ended up happening, other than my own speculation. I had no idea what their magic was capable of, other than my own speculation. I had no idea why the emperor was so against his country, other than generic speculation on my own. I had no idea why I should care for the rebellion, other than my own speculation and so on and so forth. To me, if there is no plan to give things their proper time to be explained, then it should opt out of being included in a series until their time to shine comes to pass, especially when the reasons and a lot of the things included are <i>seemingly</i> closer to generic than not. <br /><br />Or if they're seemingly inconsistent, as they were in this book when it came to the deathless waters where more than one thing is said about them, yet they contradict each other more so than anything else. Easily one of the highlights of the book and it's in the background for no reason I can think of. <br /><br />Usually, I have zero issues reading books with similar ideas, tropes and even progressions to other books, but the execution matters a lot and I didn't get that here. The main issue, in my humble opinion once again, is that the sequence of events didn't really make sense to me or, more accurately, was the reason why I most likely couldn't get that invested in the story being told here. The explanations as I mentioned earlier, begin quite late in the book, so having these \"terms\" frequently brought up by different characters before I even know what they are or the weight behind them got old very quickly. I was ready by chapter 50 for the book to end and that's not exactly great for a book with 20 more chapters to come. <br /><br />The world is super interesting, having a culture that isn't widely used gives the author a great chance to have a uniquely rich world that is filled with lore, filled with magic and the like. This book <b>has that</b> and it even has a disease in it that is just amazingly creepy, but it's not as focused on as I hoped. I instead get the hierarchy of their world mentioned several times, I get to see applications of it, and I get to see different factions and how they treat genders to an extent. I don't get a few things when it comes to that last point because of one of the legends, but as a basis, it's still good. These parts of it were interesting, don't get me wrong, I enjoy politicking because I got to meet characters like Bhumika who is by far the best character in the book.<br /><br />Speaking of characters, other than Bhumika, I couldn't really care less about any of the rest for the majority of the book. Malini was interesting in the beginning (and in the last 10 chapters) when she was dealing with her demons which was an aspect I liked a lot, but when she met Priya, my interest starting falling; for the <b>sole reason that it felt like a YA book,</b> which is a demographic I try to avoid like the plague these days because of it being mainly romance with sprinkles of fantasy and I loathe that genre with a passion. This book started feeling like that after a little while and I didn't enjoy this part of it at all, and the amount of focus it took compared to what could have been focused on instead weighed heavily on my enjoyment. <br /><br />When I come to the villains' side, and especially because it <b>is</b> a multi pov book, I hoped to get one for the emperor just so I can get in his head a bit and see why he's doing or thinking as he does instead of just being told about his atrocities. They're awful yes, but I expect my villains to be a bit more than what seems to be just a tyrant man-child. There was a mini-villain so to speak in this one since the emperor is only mentioned by his tyrannical ways and I have yet to find a more useless existence than this supposed rebel leader, which is further emphasized by what actually ends up happening to him in a supposed climax of his arc. <br /><br />This was a messy book without even beginning to mention the nonsensical notion or anything really about the fight for the throne where something also got revealed and it felt like such a pointless addition to the book. I mean, I love names that have hidden things going for them, but not when they project badly on what has come to pass or is being discussed. <br /><br />Now that I'm finally reading my written thoughts instead of the jumbled mess in my mind, I can say one thing for sure, this book is messy because it's trying to cram a trilogy worth of books in one. A lot of the plot points in <i>The Jasmine Throne</i> could have been taken out and used for the second or third, not all of them needed to be included here when they wouldn't get the weight required to make them feel as they should to me. <br /><br />Despite all of this, I do still think that this book could have been a wonderful experience because at its core, there are so many great things wrapped up in very easy to get through writing, and yet it's buried under a lot of things that aren't as important nor as interesting, in my humble opinion once again. <br /><br />At the current time, I'm not very sure if I will end up reading the sequels, but I am interested in the world as a whole and Bhumika so who knows until then?

      "review": "I swear I haven't been as hyped reading a book as I have been with this one. The pure adrenaline of listening to 'face off' by the rock while Bhumika/Priya PUMMELS the shit out of the no good men was truly unmatched. Also Priya and Malini have the most fleshed out romance I have ever read. like. ever. which is really saying something bc thats all I read. but they really are complex individuals first coming together by the end rather than just a story about a relationship with a bow on top. Theres pieces of each other that they know and love, but at the same time theres also pieces they don't understand/understand that it is 'monstrous' either through self-hate or for power. They fight, see through each others' bullshit, and remain steadfast to their goals, even if that puts them at opposing ends at times. Although I will say that this book still has a lot of the common tropes seen in ya romance. You'll know what I mean when you read it. however it is so well done that you barely notice it/it really fits. <br /><br />Also the world?! is amazing!!!!! lots of political intrigue, and I think we'll get more of that in the next book. the ultimate baddie is more of a faceless evil guy right now. But this book sets the stage, and is more about the backstories, history, and mythology. Whats great about this book is it touches on sexism and the way women grow despite it, homophobia, imperialism, religious fanaticism in a new light despite there being so many stories, both real and fiction, around us. also representation really does matter."

Next up <a href=\"https://goodreads.com/book/show/48727813.She_Who_Became_the_Sun__The_Radiant_Emperor___1_\" title=\"She Who Became the Sun (The Radiant Emperor, #1) by Shelley Parker-Chan\" rel=\"noopener\">She Who Became the Sun</a>!<br /><br /><i>The Jasmine Throne</i> is an epic fantasy based on the epics and legends of India. The story follows Malini, a princess imprisoned for not sacrificing herself, and Priya, a maidservant that serves the temple Malini is imprisoned in. The two end up irrevocably tied when Malini witnesses Priya's forbidden magic. But while the girls are temporarily allies, they both have different goals: Malini wants to depose her wicked and cruel brother as Emperor; Priya wants to find her family and let her people be free from the Empire that rules them. <br /><br />I had a slow start with this book, but once I picked up the action, it was full steam ahead and I devoured this book in two days. This book was enthralling and I loved the exploration of family dynamics and the magic system Priya and her temple siblings use. The relationship between Priya and her temple siblings is incredibly complex and I loved seeing such a nuanced sibling relationship. The magic took me a while to really understand but damn it was so cool. It's like plant magic?? I don't even know the correct way to describe it but it was epic. <br /><br />Then there's the slow burn relationship between Malini and Priya. The way this relationship develops felt so realistic. They both want to trust each other, yet never know if they 100% can. I loved how fierce and tender these two were. I want to see more of them. I can't wait to see how their relationship will change and progress. <br /><br />Ultimately, I would say this book is about women and how women are demonized for having power. There's a big theme about being monstrous in this book, and I loved how this was shown in almost every female characters story line. We definitely see some cunning and morally grey decisions from Malini, Priya and Bhumika. And I am so here for it. Cannot wait for the sequel! <br /><br /><i>Rep: sapphic BIPOC female MC, sapphic (lesbian coded) chronically ill female MC, BIPOC supporting cast, queer side characters mentioned in a historical context.<br /><br />CWs: Abandonment, addiction, blood, past mentions of child abuse, chronic illness, colonisation, confinement, death, drug use (poison), emotional abuse, fire, injury/injury detail, lesbophobia/lesbomisia (general queerphobia/queermisia), medical content (depictions of withdrawal), misogyny, murder, physical abuse, sexism, violence, war.</i>"

The characters were boring, they all lacked personality. I didn't even understand how the two main leads fell in love because there was no hint to any sort of attraction what so ever and that annoyed me. I was expecting so much from this book and got nothing, after hitting the half way mark i forced my self to continue and eventually began skimming through it. I really did want to finish this book because it was the first time i read a book that is based on people who look like me, and with the main character having the same middle name as me i really did want to finish but i just gave up. The multiple POVs were unnecessary, I didn't care about Rao, or Ashok or Bhumika and Mithu- anyways, I did not like it. I enjoyed Prem's character- despite hardly being in the book- only because of what i saw in him rather than what the author had shown. Malini was SOOO boring, and so was Priya. How could two badass characters be written so badly? I don't score 1 star much, i don't even remember the last I did but this book? Disappointed. <br /><br />Oh well, i did not expect this book to be this bad because all i have ever heard are such positive reviews."

      "review": "The Jasmine Throne takes place in a lush fantasy world inspired by India. It tells an utterly feminist story complete with intriguing magic, masterful scheming, unlikely allies, and a sliver of sapphic romance.<br /><br />It took me about a month to get through this book. To be a fair, I’m a hopelessly slow reader. The pace is also admittedly slow to start, but I don’t actually see that as a flaw. There’s a lot to learn about this new world, its intricate culture and magic, its history and politics. As the first installment in a trilogy, The Jasmine Throne lays its framework down thoroughly. But more than that, beautifully. You just have to be patient—take time to absorb it all—in order to fully appreciate the story and the eloquent language used to tell it.<br /><br />Told in third-person past tense with multiple narrators, The Jasmine Throne is an impressively woven tale. The main POVs belong to our hidden priestess, Priya, and captive princess, Malini. But there are a number of other secondary POVs that contribute to the full scope of the political landscape. I appreciated being given a glimpse into the minds of other players in the conflict/seeing how they interpret the world and their role in it. All of the characters are authentically complex and the author provides interesting insight regarding their motives, revealing their different faces as the story unfolds. As for the romance, it takes a backseat to Priya’s personal development and the action of the overall plot. But I found that realistic considering the circumstances.<br /><br />The theme that struck me most deeply is the pursuit of liberation for an oppressed people. Parijat’s aim to obliterate Ahiranya—in livelihood and identity—is heavy, and I feel emotionally invested in seeing things made right. Another theme that struck a chord with me is the untangling of the twisted way those in power warp religion to support flawed and wicked agendas. And I absolutely loved the hopeful way the book ends. <input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"spoiler__control\" aria-label=\"The following text has been marked spoiler.

World building- AMAZING. Everything was clearly well planned, the settings and the surroundings present well described. The mythology, the temple, the everything! Berry berry good A++! 😻<br /><br />2. The portrayal of rage, grief, the things that motivate these people to do the things that they do- it was handled really well. You could really imagine yourself in their places and understand their actions and inner thoughts. Except Chandra. I am not even going to try to understand that vile man. *shudder* <br /><br />3. The build-up. The PLOT. Okay it’s really really great- just take my word for it because I don’t want to spoil even one iota! <br /><br />4. Romance: One of the things that I loved about this book is that romance wasn’t a major plot point- many things held and molded the story. Take the romance out and you’ve still got one helluva book. But yes the romance is great, THE BUILD UP. <br /><br />But seriously why are you still here reading my sorry excuse for a review? Slowburn, enemies to reluctant alllies to lovers. Badass, fiery ladies who team-up to set an empire ablaze and are set ablaze by their love for each other. Morally grey lesbian power couple! 🔪🔪 Isn’t that enough of a reason to pick this up?? Go! Do the will of the sapphic gods! Your sapphic heart will thank you 😊. "

      "review": "The Jasmine Throne was, in a sense, 100% what I expected. Good sapphic romance, good arc, and good plot, as well as a bit more. Stick to the end if you want me to rant about this book and its similarity to Avatar: the Last Airbender.<br /><br />Setting<br />It's a pretty tight setting. However, world-building doesn't leave much to the imagination and everything will be revealed eventually. It's only book 1, but I find little mystery in the setting in the long term. That being said, everything from the war to the plague feels like a good enough tapestry.<br /><br />Plot<br />Pretty much the first half and the romance are handled very well. The politics and transition between chapters are perfect to the 't'. I have a massive issue with the quality drop around halfway to the end of the story. Character arcs and actions suddenly spontaneously fill the page and some pretty anti-climatic resolutions to the world-building. Plus, the author throws a bunch of new characters and world-building that do not seem to connect well with the first half, making it feels like it drags out at some parts and a detriment to the climax.<br /><br />Character (basically everything I love about this story)<br />Priya - I love her. She is a delightful protagonist with a lot of hard choices and flawed actions. She have a ton of personality and growth over the story, opening her closeted ambition for romance and ambition. She feels so connected to Ahiranya and the cast, probably one of the most engaging pro-active heroines I'd read in 2021.<br /><br />Malini - She is more than a caged bird, a sleeping beauty. She has so much strength and vulnerability that I feel horrible whenever she berates herself for her basic needs for survival. Lying and coercing aren't something to be taken lightly, and Malini handles her inner demons very well. I'm excited to see her growth in the sequel. Her arc shows her more than just a trauma victim and a paper tiger.<br /><br />Bhumika - Ok, so I didn't expect her to be the biggest badass in the story. Sometimes, I kinda forgot that she is pregnant, and then she kinda kicks everybody's ass. As a character, her action and inaction make her the most interesting and unique character of any fantasy genre. She isn't a Marie Sue, because everything she did up to this point in her life gives her all the tools. However, it is unfortunate that you didn't explore her emotional vulnerability at times, especially her husband's death. <br /><br />Ashok - He is in-between hateful and tragic. I do like his conclusion.<br /><br />Ruhk - Cute kid. Did his best to stay alive. Morally grey to the bone.<br /><br />Altogether, I really appreciate how you tie their arcs together so perfectly. I also appreciate you including a diverse and positive male cast, all of which fits well into the story without overreaching.<br /><br /><br />SPOILER<br />This section is just for people who have seen the show Avatar: The Last Airbender and read the book. I have my suspicion that the bad guy's fire motif in Jasmine Throne borrows heavily from the show:<br /><br />Ozai has some striking similarities to Chandra. Both being the driven force of the events in the story and are personally responsible for mass genocide. They operate strict regime with prejudice. Both don't show their face until much, much later, and usually with a menacing atmosphere (Ozai being a looming shadow in front of a wall of fire and Chandra daydreaming about burning his sister).<br /><br />Iroh and Aditya's passivity amidst the war while trying to explore a different way to resolve their respective family feud. Both also a mentor of sort and started a secret rebellion against their brother. Both are also first sons who should've inherited the throne, but chose not to.<br /><br />Santok is basically General Zhao who is power-hungry and bigoted toward those not of their respective ethnic group. (The honorable duel scene might also be inspired by the concept of Agni Kai?)<br /><br />Azula, a princess who had a traumatic past and a complicated family relationship. She is what Malini could've been. Her arc revolves around her immoral decisions stemming from her background. She also have episodes where she imagines her dead mother loving her, an emotion she cannot accept. Malini also went through this over the story.<br /><br />And that's it. I just found them strikingly similar."

      "review": "I remember when I first saw this book on a list of highly anticipated 2021 releases and thought that it was probably not going to be for me. While I found the idea of a setting inspired by Indian history and folklore as well as the perspective of a sapphic romance very intriguing, I did not think I would like the rest of the plot all that much. I'm so glad I gave it a chance despite my reservations! <br />To keep it brief, I loved the setting, the world building, and the magic system. I do think that the author ought to do more with these elements in the sequels, but I'm very pleased with the current state of the art, especially considering she established all of it in only one book. Admittedly, I am a bit confused about the dimensions of Parijatdvipa -- it seems to be a big country, but travel is remarkably fast -- but that's essentially the only flaw that stood out to me.<br />I generally feel like the entire book is very... elaborate, I suppose. One can tell that the author put a lot of care and effort into all of the details (as well as the writing, which is very pretty as well). Of course, it is a fairly big book (as in: a royal hardback of over 500 pages with a kind of small-ish font), so you'd definitely expect a lot of detail. Moreover, creating a world/plot this detailed demands a lot of explanation, which inevitably leads to a slower pace. Personally, I did not mind that at all, but I imagine that it might be challenging for some readers.<br />I would also like to extend my positive judgement regarding the great amount of detail to the characters. Both Priya and Malini are very three-dimensional and I enjoyed the both of them immensely. Priya is certainly my favourite, but I still like Malini a lot. I also appreciate the effort the author put into the side characters. Although I am not a fan of multiple perspectives in novels -- I was a tad annoyed whenever the perspective shifted to someone who wasn't Priya -- I can absolutely value the depth given to the other pov characters. I also think that all character development made sense and was well explained and executed. Again, this is admittedly one reason why the pace is a bit slower: Character development takes some time if you want it to be credible. One thing I would have liked to see more of is the romance. While there was an ever-present tension and even attraction between Priya and Malini, there was little in terms of actual romance. I'm not quite as disappointed as I was in <a href=\"https://goodreads.com/book/show/54467051.The_Unbroken__Magic_of_the_Lost___1_\" title=\"The Unbroken (Magic of the Lost, #1) by C.L. Clark\" rel=\"noopener\">a certain book I read earlier this year</a>, but I think that if you market a book with the promise of a sapphic love story, it would do no harm to actually live up to the expectations you yourself created.<br />Either way, I enjoyed this book a great deal and although the ending was satisfying, I am already very excited for the sequel. It took me quite a while to get through it, both due to its length and slower pace and due to my lack of free time over the last few weeks. I wish I could have read this in fewer sittings and over a shorter period of time -- I actually think I might have enjoyed it even more."

      "review": "A sapphic desi epic fantasy is something I never thought I would read, and never knew I so badly needed to read. Aside from elements of queer romance, which hell yeah, this story has so much to offer. An empire inspired by South Asian-style kingdoms, Parijatdvipa maintains rule over its member nation-states based on the historical immolation of the mothers, which is a religious metaphor and a story-accurate historical fact, in the face of mythological animistic god-creatures, the yaksa. The nation-state of Ahiranya, home of the worshipped and defeated yaksa, lost in this historic conquest and are denied of their heritage and connection with their living gods. Ahiranya exists as a state in colonial subjugation, with all the trappings one may expect. They're also experiencing a plague turning people into plants and a religious purist, homicidal new emperor who is determined to purify the world by burning women left and right, starting with his sister, one of our main protagonists.<br /><br />So if the above did not explain enough, the world-building here is out of control. This book is full of so many intense feelings, so much intrigue and righteous anger, and I am here for ALL OF IT. I was that person who asked my library to pre-order the book, loved it, bought my own copy, and am now bereft imagining waiting for the sequel to come out. Cannot recommend this enough for my queer fantasy nerds. Be warned if you can't stomach violence."

I would have liked it to be a little bit more fast-paced and not all POVs were equally interesting to me.<br /><br />But everything else, woah. The politics, the buildup of the tension and the stakes, the characters and all the different kinds of relationships represented. While the base of the story, overthrowing a cruel emperor, might not be the most unique, everything else makes this such a fresh story. The magic, the different religions (considering a lot of fantasy stories sorta go with one religion for everyone, or atl only one that's rly worked out), the importance and differences of all the female characters, and so much more.<br /><br />Also, this book has definitely made me reconsider something about my reading tastes. In terms of romance stories, I have never picked up a sapphic story. This is simply because the sort of self-insert (for lack of better description) enjoyment I get out of romances isn't there for me without a male character. But this has also kept me away from other genres of books that involve love stories between two women and I really need to stop doing that. While it may not 'hit' the same 'spot', I definitely adored Priya and Malini and hope, almost against hope, there's a happy ending for them."

      "review": "I wish I had more energy to write a more thorough review, but of the three books I have read lately featuring the same SFF princess-peon lesbian plot line (The Unspoken Name, hated it beyond imagining; The Unbroken, pretty darn good!) this was the best. The romance was the best and most plausible, the world was most thoroughly built (even though pretty complex), the magic elements most compelling, and the moral questions best explored without providing clear answers. <br /><br />I do suggest reading it and The Unbroken against each other, because they are so VERY similar in broad questions of power, empire, loyalties, politics, and general plot but still somehow SOOO different in almost every possible way otherwise. Literally, the premise of both is: one MC is local to a colonized outer territory of a great empire, but has been persecuted and their culture/community was taken away from them, and now they have a superficially pretty darn negative reaction to their past life and have acclimated to living within an empire, doing what they can for others like them, but not nostalgic for the past. The other MC is a princess of the foreign colonizing power who is out of favor/out of power with pretty evil forces controlling the capital of the empire, and is sent to the far-away territory as a sort of punishment. Turns out our two MCs can help each other achieve their own goals, brought together by desperation though hampered by mutual distrust. Along the way they fall problematically in lust/possible love with each other, the first MC rediscovers the beauty of her cultural heritage, the second MC is torn between wanting to help the oppressed conquered people that are now humanized to her and her goals for seizing power and the imperial throne, which require her more or less to bring this rebellious outer colony to heel. In both stories, there are characters of moral black, white, and grey (mostly grey) within the imperial administration and within the indigenous resistance movement. <br /><br />While the Unbroken had genius elements--a breathtaking depiction of the pain of loving your own oppressor, the inability for the princess MC to think as a purely moral agent and instead to see everything solely through the lens of accruing her own advantage and power, among other things--all told, I found The Jasmine Throne more compelling. In part this is because the relationship between the two MCs is much more balanced in terms of power (this is just pleasing to me, not necessary for a book to be good!) and the romance therefore more plausible (what they admire in each other makes sense!).<br /><br />EDIT: Other things I loved about The Jasmine Throne included really sharp and relevant analysis of patriarchal gender politics, whereas The Unbroken had a world where gender was almost irrelevant to power (which I find implausible/less interesting--and if you want to go that route, do it thoughtfully as in Ancillary Justice?). The Unbroken might have used more ink consciously discussing local religion vs. empire and how those two power structures relate, but I actually found the relationship between the two in The Jasmine Throne a little more interesting, if only because there are two competing religions AND a religion-apathetic worldview all in competition. If both books explore the limits of individual power and agency in complex worlds of entrenched oppressive structures, The Jasmine Throne poses perhaps more poignant questions about what gets sacrificed in the search for power, depicting those sacrifices as conscious choices: the moral compass of the Princess, and the selfhood/soul? of the Priestess, in this instance. And what does that mean for personal attachments? The moral imperative to act for the greater good (even if getting blood on your hands) versus the moral imperative to do good; the gamble of committing either to action or to inaction; the paralyzing burden of self-doubt in an uncertain world (Princess's eldest brother) vs. the hubris of unquestioning self-confidence in one's goals and morality (Priestess's elder brother). <br /><br />All this being said, The Unbroken is also 1289478723658723% worth reading and my preference for The Jasmine Throne can easily be summed up as personal preference!!!"

      "review": "I really liked the overall plot of the book. It was a bit predictable at times about where the story was going. I figured out that Malini will be better suited as the empress and that Rao’s name had something to do with that pretty early on. But it didn’t diminish my enjoyment of the story. I felt satisfaction when that’s where the story went. <br /><br />I liked the magic system a lot too though it’s not very clear. From what I gather it’s a soft elemental magic system and it works for the story. I quite like the name deathless waters.<br /><br />The world building was not the greatest but it worked for a first book of the series. I want to see more of the world, the other cultures in the next book. I really liked the Arolan people who follow the nameless god, and how they are given a name that’s a prophecy and it’s hidden from everyone. It’s a very unique concept. I also really liked all the descriptions of food. I’m south Asian myself, so to see a representation of the foods I grew up eating in a fantasy book is really amazing to me. Personally, I really like food descriptions in fantasy books.<br /><br />I didn’t like Priya much. I thought she was a bit bland and quite stubborn at times. I couldn’t feel any of her motives for what she was doing or what even her intentions were. She was a bit clueless throughout the book for me. Malini on the other hand I really liked. She’s ruthless, cunning, ambitious, and knows how to use people to get what she wants. She should be the one to sit on the throne. I was really annoyed when she kept rallying for her brother and doing all the work for him when he didn’t even want the throne. But I understand we needed to go through all that to get to the point where she realizes that she’s much better than both of her useless brothers and she’s should be the empress. She’s not good or evil. She does what needs to be done and I love it! I love her! My another favourite character is Bhumika, who coincidentally is also a lot like Malini. Girl married the guy who killed her adoptive family, pulled all the strings behind her husbands back and made him do her bidding which he didn’t even realize he was doing. She turned his entire household, his army against him. Made them loyal to her, and in the end killed her own husband! Now that’s an achievement. Kudos to her! Love her love her love her. The rest of the characters weren’t developed that well in my opinion. I wanted Rao, Prem, and Aditya to be more developed. I wanted more from Rao and Prems friendship. I wanted to feel the pain when prem died but I had no emotional attachment to him or what Rao felt for him. Ashok too was underdeveloped. I hope he’s not dead and we get more of him in the next book. Oh I really liked Rukh. He was so cute!<br /><br />I also wished that the book spent a bit more time on the romance, but I’m glad to get even this much. A lesbian romance in a fantasy book. And that too a south Asian inspired fantasy book? That’s all you gotta say to me and I’ll eat it up.<br /><br />Overall, I really enjoyed it and can’t wait for the next one. Also, Chandra needs to die."

Idk what the plan is for the rest of the series though, maybe the author will deepen their bond as the story progresses. For now they still feel like strangers to me?? I don't know this technically had everything that id love in a romance but it didn't click for me and im so sad abt it. Anyways, as far as world building goes though, i really liked it and how the book's themes were handled. And i love every character especially the women."

      "review": "[cracks knuckles] alright lets do this<br /><br /><b>buddy read w <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/burakh\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">ratté</a>&lt;3</b><br /><br />i have no idea how to start this but tl;dr this book is messy, it does a lot of show-not-tell that i'm not a fan of, i think it tries to be everything all at once that a lot of things comes off as really empty, and character motivations are incredibly inconsistent that it blows my mind. i read this w my beloved ratté and it was really fun for us to check if our information is accurate and also picking it apart~<br /><br />*as i was reading this book i've come to the conclusion that this book's target audience just wasn't for me, so do with this information however u like<br /><br />but let me start off w <b>the things i liked!</b><br />- i like the banter and easy back-and-forth between priya/malini that shows their differences in terms of how/where they were raised, and how thee teachings of each culture influences their subsequent motivations (however little there is), but i am not sold on their romance as of yet<br /><br />- i love bhumika. she's the only character in this book that was <i>shown</i> to actually get things done and i could actually feel the weight of her consequences compared to the other characters. she is the most interesting – and if u want to go there – morally grey character in this book i've read. i love her. <br /><br />- the loyalty priya and malini have towards their country<br /><br />- the water + house as a sentient thing throughout the book. the yaksa is cool we love the yaksa<br /><br />- ashok is stupid as a rebel leader, but i like his character. he just has a one-track mind about violence and at least in that sense he's consistent. and i love his dynamics with priya. the best one from the book.<br /><br />- the hallucinations malini experienced of her heart sisters, i think it establishes well how much loss, grief and trauma she'd experienced and had to suppress because of all of what she had to go through after<br /><br />what i <b>don't like:</b> <br />(note for heavy spoilers; and it's v long)<br /><input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"spoiler__control\" aria-label=\"The following text has been marked spoiler. Toggle checkbox to reveal or hide.\" onchange=\"this.labels[0].setAttribute('aria-hidden', !this.checked);\" id=\"85b842df-5c3b-4138-8a41-5331f5d92b09\" /><label aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"spoiler\" for=\"85b842df-5c3b-4138-8a41-5331f5d92b09\"><br /><br />- this book runs on Information Deliberately Withheld Until It's Convenient to Further the Plot and i hate it. the amount of times i could cry because i was so frustrated that i was given <i>no information</i>, or baited <i>with</i> it to the point where it makes zero sense as to why i wasn't told anything then, so half the time what they're saying makes no sense to me, which...doesn't make for an immersive experience. i keep trying to understand the characters and their motivation, but i can't do that if i don't have information to base my guesses/theories on. <br /><br />- like for example, how does the deathless waters work? do they choose to go in whenever they want to? because that seems to be it towards the end of the book w ashok. which begs the question of: so why all the hassle about it if it can happen at one's whims (provided they survived), and what happens in there? do they all get visions of the yaksa? this wasn't clear. this book has got to that point where i <b>want</b> to be spoon fed with information because there was none, and i usually despise info-dumps<br /><br />- you really don't have to go #girlboss and give all the guys virtually zero personalities and motivations. they are characters you've created; <i>yours&lt;.</i> you don't have to go, 'all men is crap and useless.' that is a sentiment that, should it exists, conveyed in a way that effectively shows its nuances (and i refuse to entertain that sentiment in and of itself because the weight it holds has long since outlived its original intentions) – or it's just an echo-chamber (i'm not saying op holds this opinion, though i can't help but notice a consistent pattern as i read on which might lead me to question things) <br /><br /><b>[cont]</b> because tell me — what <i>has</i> he done to warrant getting boo-ed off the throne? and no, the burning of three highborn women and mocking it as he does it isn't sufficient enough. i honestly expected more: maybe he'd created systems to actively oppress and eradicate certain group of people, and if this is something that we <i>haven't</i> seen and has yet to happen......i've no words. i really don't (i'd argue that for a book whose main characters have based their motivation and hope on getting rid of the antagonist, i'd think you would need to be more clear on that on the get-go but i digress) <br /><br /><b>[cont]</b> his actions must be equally severe for it to carry heavy repercussions, such as removing him from the throne, because this something that could carry serious amount of damage and instability to its citizens, and so far i have yet to see them stop to think about this for even a moment. one would argue that (me. the one is me) this is textbook; black-and-white morality: you're either with malini, or you're commending chandra's — and subsequently the whole of parijat highborn's — ideals, morals, and actions.<br /><br /><b>[cont]</b> one concurrent them in this book is these characters' actions have zero consequences, so it doesn't even pressing or dangerous to me. there were no consequences dealt out to the people involved. this feels like more of a personal vengeance to me acted out in the name of some sense of 'justice' (honestly i'd be more inclined to explore this arc instead if given the choice), and i know that's definitely not the case <br /><br />- i can see the appeal and why people describe this as a morally grey book, but all i see is inconsistent characters with motivations that either a) does not make sense or b) happens conveniently to further the plot <br /><br />- priya had the audacity to ask, 'why is this man bad' towards the very man she's rebelling against. i have no words (this needs to be its own point bc i had to put the book down and lay on the floor after)<br /><br />- chandra? hello? he's supposed to be the antagonist of this book and every time the book pushes that he's the bad guy, all i get was \"he literally burns women. is that not enough?\" (verbatim) no it's not. it really isn't; there are more ways to establish him as an antagonist enough to justify him carrying one whole book, i haven't even <i>seen</i> him appear save for in the beginning and end, or in flashbacks. and i'm supposed to be scared of him and what he can do? i am TOLD that he has his own motivations, but i don't see him executing said motivations to fit his own goals yet <br /><br />- the whole thing with aditya. i just. i can't even begin to put in words how baffled i was – first of all, why would they even <i>think</i> to go after aditya when he'd chosen to give up the throne? and i know people will say that's alluded to the the whole \"duty versus fate\" thing going on, but this is the <i>weakest</i> way to go about illustrating the point. he made a CHOICE, and now he has 4812093120 people at his home, mocking his faith, crying and begging for him to take the throne?? how would that even <i>work,</i> and what was the plan in the event that he adamantly refuses to come back? are they just like <i>'fingers crossed, hope he says yes!' ???</i> that's delusional and you're supposed to take down the <i>emperor.</i> i'd imagine they would all have a more convincing and sound plan than that<br /><br />- which leads me to: how do these visions/prophecies work? why is rao having a vision about a country-state that he has nothing to do with? arguably one can say that well, they rule the entire nation, so it affects him too—but <i>how?</i> what are the boundaries and rules here when it comes to people getting prophecies: is it only the highborn? does <i>every</i> citizen get it too? do they also have prophecies about ahiranya? and also, malini doesn't even <i>believe</i> in the nameless god and their faith, so why?? and like, so she gets to mock aditya for choosing to pursue his faith/vision but she gets to revel in it bc it so conveniently fits her agenda?? make it make sense op <br /><br />- what about the rebellion? didn't they attack the...i dunno, somewhere? or were they just specifically targeting the mahal? and that was it? you've spent the whole book building up to this and i didn't even get a whisper of the consequences of said rebellion? and ashok just...leaves in the middle of it to hunt down priya?? how does that work <br /><br />- i don't understand how priya is always unnecessarily rude to bhumika, after all she's done for her. is she resentful bc in her eyes bhumika has never made an effort to be closer to her, given their shared trauma and grief, because at least in that sense they would have each other? i'm guessing that's the case, or it would make no sense to me. and then i have priya going, 'why do we have to be so rude to each other?' ...well you tell me that's what i'd like to know too<br /><br />- the whole \"power corrupts\" thing.......it has a point but it's not executed well in a manner that carries weight <br /><br />- this book is literally just telling me things without having any solid foundation or illustration to fall back on. malini going, 'the throne is aditya's by imperial blood, and because he's Better than chandra in every way so he <i>has</i> to be emperor. trust me, i would know. i mean, have you seen what he did to me?' is <i>not enough</i> justification for it to become an important plot which then (conveniently) carries into 'actually, malini was destined to be empress all along, so surprise!' so what was all that? that just tells me chandra is a shitty person. and she intends to overthrow a whole empire by taking down the <i>emperor</i>, but the whole plan is just hinging on something fragile that i don't see how it can work. if the whole intention of the arc is for it to serve as a plot twist, then i'd imagine it needs to be <b>convincing</b> enough for it to be strong enough to surprise the readers.<br /><br /><b>[cont]</b> i think that malini having gone through all the abuse, violence, and subsequent manipulation is telling enough in how desperate she wants her brother off the throne, but that's about it. for all the buildup into her fighting for aditya to become the emperor, and ONLY to snatch it all back and go, <i>actually rao might have known all along that malini should step up the throne!</i> is just mind-boggling to me. it's not even a surprise because it's so, so pointless. you could've had that in the beginning. you could've established that as a starting-point for malini, having something to fight for and believe in that is more solid and kicks off an arc, but all i get was <i>this,</i> whatever this is<br /><br />- i briefly scrolled past a review that says something about how the book ended the way it'd started it and i took a pause. and WOW. whoever you are, if u see this you're RIGHT! i'm so sorry i lost your review, but i get what ur saying! i don't know what was the plot of this book, and since <i>so</i> many plot points or key moments were reversed as we near the end (god knows what's up w this thing going on), i've no idea if we made any progress since we started<br /><br />- one more thing: aren't priya and malini by nature supposed to be enemies or did i miss something? isn't malini's family/bloodline responsible for the wreckage and damage done to her family? well, even before she found out that her elders were responsible for the deaths of her siblings....still, that doesn't erase the point that they weren't supposed to help each other right from the beginning. priya resents bhumika for <i>marrying</i> into the enemy but the same rule doesn't apply to someone born into one? sure, this was pointed out at one point........but it amounted to nothing; nothing was resolved and lead to nothing further than that. just thrown in the open. just so We Know its <i>kinda</i> addressed? i'm so done<br /><br />- lastly, take a shot every time any character says \"burns women\" thats it thats the book&lt;3</label>"

      "review": "Okay so I am conflicted on this. Boy am I conflicted.<br />On one hand, there is SO much to love here. First off, the style is wonderful, vivid and poetic without being unnatural. The speech patterns and dialogues work really well except for the usage of the word \"okay\" (which adult fantasy seems addicted to, and I don't get why, it yanks me STRAIGHT out the story). Then, the magic system and the fantasy elements... Bruh, I am dying over here. They are so good. I absolutely adored the river imagery, the luscious greenery that is both comforting and stuff of horrors, the flesh/nature merging. I could listen to the descriptions of various magical beings in this book for so long. I also loved the worldbuilding, I was super hooked onto every detail about various cultures and traditions of the countries described (especially the Nameless stuff - the prophecy aspect of names, the religion, it is all so so so cool). <br />On another hand, all those wonderful inanimate features are explored by wooden, lifeless characters, which sucks for me because characters are my most important parameter for enjoyment. The author really should have cut the cast by like half and dedicated more time to making them all feel unique and separate. There is way too many POVs sounding like the same person is narrating, some of which are side characters that serve only exposition without much character building. Like yeah theoretically I LOVE the story the characters are acting out, but I can't bring myself to care about them. I think this might change in book 2 because towards the end of the story Malini develops some thinking patterns that differ from the rest, so she automatically jumped to my fav character place (sorry Bhumika). The romance also suffered from this, I have felt no chemistry or interest in the lead couple (which SUCKS I wanted to love them SO BADDDDD instead I focused on Bhumika's marriage but that too was dropped soon). <br />All in all, I am absolutely down to clown with book 2. I see lots of potential here. I might change my rating later but for now it's 4 stars because I truly did enjoy pretty much every aspect except characters and romance."

      "review": "This book is promising from page one, beginning with the set up of a pyre someone is inevitably going to burn on. There is complete truth here when I tell you it is just as exhilarating the rest of the way through. In an world where its Emperor is monstrous, there are many that wish to see him dethroned. Priya, a maidservant to the regent and his wife, and Malini, the Emperor's traitor sister, make reluctant allies as they find themselves mixed up in plots to end the Emperor's reign at last. It's a multi-POV book with voices so distinct, it won't be hard to follow along with the many stories playing out.<br /><br />This book does center the politics more than anything, but the romance is still lovely. I know many will go into this rooting for our main love interests. Your heart will simultaneously glow and crush. The weaving of religion into the plot of the world is breathtaking. It adds a layer to the politics we often only get to see from white authors. A fresh perspective is given on what a division of beliefs means for people's safeties and morals. The author also perfectly portrays characters reminiscing on life pre-colonialism, wanting freedoms they are no longer granted. <br /><br />The idea of everything in this world not being black and white compels the reader to question who they might root for. I found myself unsure of my views on certain characters and the decisions they would make. The complexities of each relationship in this book give everything so much more meaning. I especially was compelled by the relationship between Priya and her brother, Ashok. There is no one burning feeling Priya has towards her brother, complicating everything it seems she needs to do. We get to see her heart twist with every thought she spares towards him and their past. <br /><br />My favourite perspectives were [of course] the women's. Each was vastly different, providing for distinct outlooks on the events that occur. How can I not love women fighting against a system that deems them monstrous?<br /><br />You will be taken by the writing, the world, and the characters who only desire their independence and a better living."

      "review": "Oh my god I do not know why but I wasn’t ready for this masterpiece of a book. An absolutely astounding first book to a duology.<br /><br />I rarely give 5 stars these days as I review more and more but this book has had such an impact on me. Every time I was not reading it, I either wanted to pick it back up again or trying to think of theories of what is happening and what is going to happen next. I guess you could say I was obsessed.<br /><br />This book had the perfect amount of romance to fantasy in my opinion. There was so much politics yet the slow burn love was so good and it hurt so much I just could not stop learning and understand and grieving over and over.<br /><br />Now this book had a lot of POV’s and when that happens, it is very easy to leave some characters behind and readers roll their eyes when they reach ‘that character’s’ POV. But this did not happen. This book has like 10 POV’s and all of them were interesting. I think what made them great was one the author kept them near other characters we already knew about and it made it easier to follow other POV’s. I just enjoyed it so much.<br /><br />Our 2 main characters aka ONE TRUE PAIRING. I love them so much. I love that they are sapphic. This is a call for more sapphic fantasy. It was just so damn good. AND NO MISS COMMUNICATION. Like omg the girls just always talked about their feelings and I was like ‘woah this is so good like they understand each other!’ They had the most heartbreaking story and I devoured every word of it.<br /><br />The plot was just stupendous. I will say I was a little confused at the start for like 50 pages but after that it was a roller coaster of a ride. I know some people found this book a bit long but I felt all the story telling and character development really helped me gravitate towards the characters and really care for their wellbeing and their relationships. I know I have said this so many times but this story was just so good. I am so excited and sad to read the next book because I know this is a duology but man I want to saver it as much as possible. <br /><br />This book may be the highlight of my year. :)"

      "review": "THAT WAS TOTALLY EPIC!!!<br /><br />Trust me when I say this. THE JASMINE THRONE is such an epic, epic fantasy, the first book in The Burning Kingdom trilogy. It was one of the bestest epic fantasies I've ever read. I'm not exaggerating. It truly was glorious, solid, and mind-blowingly larger-than-life. If you loved Indian epic movies like the Baahubali series, and books such as THE TIGER AT MIDNIGHT by Swati Teerdhala, HUNTED BY THE SKY by Tanaz Bhathena, THE STAR-TOUCHED QUEEN by Roshani Chokshi, and THE BOOKS OF AMBHA duology by the same author as THE JASMINE THRONE, you'll love this new series too. It's epic, it's sapphic, it's full of magic and politics.<br /><br />The story is set in Parijatdvipa, an empire divided into five city states: Ahiranya, Alor, Dwarali, Saketa, and Srugna, with the capital city, Harsinghar in the middle like the center of a flower. But the story mainly happens in Ahiranya, particularly in Hiranaprastha, the capital of Ahiranya, with some last chapters happening in Srugna. The two protagonists are Priya, an Ahiranyi maidservant (and ex priestess), and Malini, the Parijati Princess. Malini is the Parijati emperor's sister and his prisoner, sent to the defunct, ruined temple of Hiranaprastha, the Hirana, where years ago, the temple elders and children were burned alive at the hands of the emperor's soldiers due to the elders and children's monstrous yaksa powers. Princess Malini spends her day imprisoned inside the temple building, sentient and mercurial. Priya is one of the maids who climbs to the temple weekly with other maids to maintain the building. Once they meet, passions both romantic and selfish erupt inside them. Together—and apart—the two women of powerful blood running through them wield weapons of their own, be they magical and catastrophic, or political and courtly intrigue.<br /><br />Alongside Priya and Malini's point-of-views, you'll also come across many supporting characters who provide their own perspectives as well as events out of both Priya and Malini's reach. There's Bhumika, Ahiranya's regent's meek, softhearted (or is she?) wife. I absolutely adore her. She's my most favorite character in this book, the most levelheaded, sane, and judicious person in this book. Then there's Ashok, a zealous Ahiranyi rebel who'll stoop to any level to free his country from the imperial reign. I also like Prince Rao, a secretive prince of Alor who's on a secret mission in Hiranaprastha. There's Vikram, Ahiranya's regent and a few more characters. None of them are unimportant. Even the few characters who appear only once as the POV character in chapters are full of realistic, human traits.<br /><br />What I love about THE JASMINE THRONE is how widespread the world is. In many fantasies, the world is stagnated inside one city or region, from the POV of one character. Here, we get characters of all personalities and backgrounds. They all have their good and bad sides. Nobody is a goody-goody person. They want to be free. They want to survive. They want to wield powers. They want to control things. Who among us never wanted those? Not only that, I love how rich and deeply thought out the cultures are. A lot of fantasy authors base their make-believe cultures on real world ones. However, although the cultures of THE JASMINE THRONE bear resemblances to the many diverse cultures in India, you'll not find their real-life cultural counterparts, if there are any. The three main religions, the Ahiranyi yaksa, the Nameless God of Alor and Srugna, and the five mothers of Parijatdvipa, they all bear resemblances and differences with real world religions. It's very fascinating to a fantasy nerd like me who loves to observe such things (and glean pleasure from it).<br /><br />I love the parallel between Priya and Malini. They both are feral women who are forced to hide their desires, be it romantic and sexual, or about power and thus monstrously selfish. Priya's power is visible, hence her strength is more physical and palpable. Malini's power is mental and psychological. She's a master manipulator of the mind, while Priya is a master manipulator of the flora and the earth. They've both suffered terribly at the hands of people they loved and trusted. Fire ravaged their early lives: while Priya escaped from the burning of her temple family, Malini escaped from the pyre her brother built where he burned her best friends. Both have brothers who are zealots in nature: Priya's brother will commit violence of any kind to anyone to wrest the freedom of Ahiranya, while Malini's brother will commit violence of any kind to anyone to spread the claws of his control over the empire. Both men use their own religions to do this, while both women struggle with their powers and try their best to retain their humanity while the world tries to make monsters out of them. This parallel was so beautifully poetic and epic... And I didn't even mention the swoonworthy romantic scenes between the two women.<br /><br />Thank you, NetGalley and Little, Brown Book Group UK (Orbit), for providing me with an eARC in exchange for my honest opinion."

      "review": "If I had a nickel for each book I read this month with a sapphic couple that consisted of a noble woman and her maidservant, I'd have two nickels. Which isn't a lot, but it's weird that it happened twice. Seriously, though, reading this book right after Priory of the Orange Tree was a wild ride, and I have such great love for both books. <br /><br />The Jasmine Throne in particular had such incredible pacing - it's go, go, go from the start and every scene was laced so much tension. It also didn't have what I called the Climax Problem that a lot of fantasy has where fantasy novels spend way too much time on build-up and resolve their climaxes too quickly. For reference, The Jasmine Throne has 500 pages, and the big final confrontation comes in at page 300, ends at around page 450, and the rest of the 50 or so pages are spent on wrap-up. That, to me, is an ideal proportion, as it allows adequate time for the author to show the consequences of the climax, both on the world and on the characters, but also lets the climax explore everything it needs to explore.<br /><br />And this novel is so rich and wonderful! The worldbuilding is top-notch - I love when fantasy novels allow their magic to be wild and irrational, because if you make magic too close to a science, I might as well just read a sci-fi novel. There's a part in chapter one where a character mentions that some of his workers went into a forest, and they emerged after two weeks thinking it had been two hours. I love that stuff! Stuff that makes the world feel mysterious and mystical. It makes me want to dive deeper into the world and learn more about it. This, to me, is one of the big advantages non-Western fantasy has over Western fantasy. Western fantasy is too played-out: the world is mostly a boring copy of medieval Europe, sometimes with dragons, maybe a wacky forest with elves if we're lucky. But non-Western fantasy can be absolutely buck-wild, with a temple that's alive and possessed by ancient demons and a pool of water hidden within it that can give people superpowers. <br /><br />The characters as well were incredibly written - I never felt as though characters were undeveloped, even though there were actually a sizable number of side characters. I always worry a bit when novels jump perspectives a lot, but this novel quickly evaded that problem by having all the side characters be closely related to each other. As such, even when we were looking at a different character, we enhanced our understanding of our main cast through their relationships with others. Some examples: Pramila, who's Malini's jailer but also the mother of her dead friend. Bhumika, who's the wife of Ahiranya's regent and lady of the household where Malini is imprisoned, but also a former \"temple sister\" of Priya, Malini's maidservant. Even Rukh and Sima, side characters introduced in Priya's early chapters, who in a lesser writer's hands would have been quickly forgotten after Priya met Malini, continuously came back throughout the novel, and their relationships with Priya were allowed to grow and change. Every character is there for a reason, which is not always an easy feat for a fantasy writer, who are charged with developing wide worlds but making us care deeply about them. <br /><br />I also loved the love story between Malini and Priya - it was a slow burn, allowed to grow and develop in the background of the novel, and I like how even after they got together, both maintained their own agency. It's too common that after two characters get together, one of them ends up playing second fiddle to the other, but in The Jasmine Throne, both retain their own individual agency and lead the story in their own ways. <br /><br />All in all, I am very excited to read The Oleander Sword. Sapphic fantasy is absolutely on fire right now and I hope this train never stops."

      "review": "I had seen this recommended on booktok as a sapphic high fantasy story based off of Indian mythology and culture, so I was definitely interested in reading it. It did take me a little bit to get into it, the story jumps right into things and changes narrators for each chapter so there were a couple plot threads I wasn't quite following when I first started reading. <br /><br />Once I got into it, oh boy was I hooked. The characters, especially the female characters, were written so well and believable. All of them had strengths and flaws and as the situations changed so did those charateristics. I was especially drawn to Priya and Malini, but also Bhumika. All of them had strength in such apparatent ways, but ways that are often overlooked by the traditional definition. Bhumika especially was a character I grew to love, but more importantly respect. She truly was doing her best, and committing to those decisions, for Ahiranya. Unlike Aditya who said that he was doing his best for his people, but couldn't commit to those decisions. <br /><br />Priya and Malini's slowburn was beautiful to read and the way that their love was shown, while keeping their characters was beautifully done. They separate hoping and wishing they could stay together, but they both know they have their own duties and responsibilities they must do separately, ones they simply can't ignore. It was very satisfying to read about the concept of a lesbian relationship in this world, because Priya's culture has not real problem with it, while Malini's does. And even though that barrier did exist, and Malina acknowledges it, it never became this tragic and hearthbreaking thing. Which as a queer person, made me happy that this common bump in a relationship wasn't addressed because it didnt really need to be. <br /><br />The universal villian of Chandra is where I'm hoping all the characters have a chance to reunite. Malini to take over the throne, Priya to find a cure for rot and return to her, Bhumika to become the leader of Ahiranya as promised. I'm excited to see where the next book goes in this story and what happens. "

      "review": "Firstly Yay a story with sapphic characters of colour. I love both Priya and Malini and how they both show us the difference in this society's culture and helping to recognise India's culture within it. It honestly don't remind me of no other Indian or Asian stories I've read or heard but maybe my view is limited. Despite integrated India's culture into the story it is still unique, I hated the multiple POVs it took me a while to willingly get pass the first 100 pages but the POVs are actually useful in letting us know how the story is going outside of Priya and Malini and seeing how things coming together.<br />Also I don't care for Priya siblings and hope she finds a story outside of serving them and their goals and get some outside of her own cause her and Bhumika do have their differences.<br />Next yes this story as sapphic characters but to me it's not necessarily a sapphic romance yes it has some action but the story isn't about them it's about changing their world for the better of both their people.<br />Not sure if this need to be a trilogy but I might see it to the end.<br /><br />Also the writing is so beautiful I have author envy cause how are they able to think so creatively and write so beautifully."

      "review": "I really enjoyed this book! This is a great first book in a new fantasy series with strong, brave, and well developed female lead characters, a fun new world and an easy to follow yet still very interesting plot line. <br /><br />I thought the world building was done exceptionally well. Some fantasy books can be very hard to follow for the first half of the book where everything is being built and explained, but this was done slowly and naturally throughout the book so the fantasy elements just seemed natural and real; not confusing at all. I was very immersed in this new world. <br /><br />I loved the romance; it was a slow burn; I always enjoy that. I'm over the insta love or the strong enemies to lovers trope where they treat each other awful and then fall madly in love. So weird. The romance in this book developed naturally and beautifully over time and I really enjoyed the lesbian romance representation. <br /><br />I personally enjoyed the first half of the book better than the second, but I feel like it could go either way for most people. The first half is more character based and I really enjoyed getting to know all of the characters and their stories. The second half is more plot based and is where a lot of the action happens, the writing style in this half got more descriptive, dreamy and poetic which was less my style but I still really enjoyed it. <br /><br />The book has strong messages about the love and bonds between family, what makes up family, accepting the ones we love no matter their faults and how far we can allow the ones we love to push us before we finally break. It discusses how we often can't help but love some people even though they have wronged us, because of the history you have been through. Love unfortunately doesn't always work like that; you can't just shut it off. It deals with a lot of political issues and the systemic removal of an entire nation of people and their fight to regain control over their lives and it also has a lot of women rising above the patriarchy and fighting for what they believe in and deserve. <br /><br />Overall, I think this is an awesome first book in a new series and I absolutely recommend picking it up when it comes out on June 8th! I will definitely be reading book two when it comes out! <br /><br />I received a copy of this book through NetGalley in exchange for my honest opinion."

      "review": "I received this as an ARC from NetGalley in exchange for a fair review.<br /><br />An elegantly written novel, The Jasmine Throne is a lyrical and languid fantasy that weaves magic and politics.<br /><br />It is beautifully constructed, in that the sentences flow with a prose that perfectly balances describing a scene and incorporating turns of phrase. I was never confused while reading it and though the world-building was on the light side of things, I understood the motivations and drives of the characters. That being said, I could have used more explanation into how the world worked regarding the various Lords and how their fiefdoms interacted with the emperor. <br /><br />I enjoyed the premise and the non-Western inspiration for the novel. The alternating viewpoints allowed for different perspectives on the action taking place, though I wish we’d gotten a few more chapters with some of the antagonists.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I found the story quite slow. Part of this could have been because I knew going in that it was a lesbian love story, so the build-up to their relationship was dampened for me given I was expecting it. While I usually prefer slow-burn love stories, this needed a lot more passion. It was too chaste for adult fantasy. I wasn’t expecting any bodice-ripping (as a sex scene isn’t necessarily the end result of sexual tension), but there was a lack of intensity behind the romance that kept me from “shipping” them as a couple. This could be because we don’t get to see the women interact other than in periods of heightened drama - they never get to flirt, to talk, to break down barriers in a casual or at least calm setting. The romance was, to put it very simply, flat. <br /><br />I really enjoyed other facets of the novel, though I didn’t love them. I thought the magic was interesting, I enjoyed the political aspects, I loved the female-centred cast, and there were side characters that I cared for, such as Rao and Captain Jeevan, but overall I was left underwhelmed by the novel. I wasn’t engaged to the point of loving it, though I believe a lot of people will be. <br /><br />It took some serious contemplation before I realized that my main issue was I found the novel a little formulaic. We know from the start what the love story will be, Priya’s connection to the Hirana took too long to get to despite the reader knowing there was one from the get-go, and I expected the twist at the end from pretty much the start. Maybe it wasn’t intended to be a twist, but it felt like it was supposed to be one, given the build-up to it. <br /><br />Don’t get me wrong - I’m not trying to tear the novel down. I think it’s a beautiful book that I did enjoy, I just feel the need to explain why I didn’t love it. Will I read the next in the series? I’m not sure if I’m compelled enough, to be honest. <br /><br />I’m recommending it to people who enjoy lyrical fantasy. "

Honestly, as an Indian lesbian who was closeted for the majority of my life, reading a book like this was healing; a gorgeously queer, feminist and authentically-Indian fantasy book.<br /><br />There’s so much about this book that I loved. Priya and Malini’s relationship was a breath of fresh air because they weren’t in love. There’s a lot of grey in their relationship, a lot of trust issues and schemes to sift through on both ends. They felt real, and human, and honest.<br /><br />The writing was simple in the best of ways: the author was able to convey what she needed to without having to gone on long rants and explanations. Less was so much more in this book.<br /><br />I love the world, the city-states, the magic system and the rot, the multiple character perspectives to give insight into this divided empire. I was rooting for so many and sympathising with others.<br /><br />Will be reading the next book immediately."

(not the story) i am in fact raising white flags bc what was the point.<br /><br />the plot was SO thin already. half of the writing choices were just. politely put, made no sense at all. a prisonbreak with a side rebellion that barely had any consequences. 1/4 pov switch ups were from the \"rebels\" side and i just REALLY cant get over the fact that <input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"spoiler__control\" aria-label=\"The following text has been marked spoiler.

(i mean it sort of ended in the middle itself but thats not the point, for the sake of the argument we say ashok dies nd thats it) bc priya and malini did jailbreak and struck a deal (ah yes bc zabaan. which ok yes it carries weight but it also doesnt make much sense here specifically) then ashok and priya had a heartfelt and went 'oh trust me brother. we will free ahrinya.' and boom ending. and yes i know a rebellion isnt just the violent rebels on screen. but one bar scene with poets singing about war and revolution doesnt exactly cut it out as <i>'Best Book Ever!'</i> </label><br /><br />and while we are on the characters. the antagonist, please. please. i laughed a couple times at this point but alright. that 'antagonist' had zero presence in the book. his motivations being just a word on page doesnt exactly cut it for the most compelling antagonist. like, his personality is really just burning women. the textbook villain approach just took me out. adult fiction, really? i also cant get over the fact that the book ends with our first 2 page epilogue that is in fact from his pov and he does a lil evil laugh and swirls wine and looks at the pyre and is like: ah sister, cannot wait to burn you. like. thats it. the rest u are just told (which is one of my biggest issues with this book) that hes a monster nd cruel nd a misogynist blah blah blah. ok honestly if a writer doesnt love their antagonist, they are gonna come out as stale. and it's really evident here. <br /><br />like be real, at one point priya actually (verbatim) asked what makes the emperor a bad man. and malini (one of the imperial siblings) actually said 'isnt burning women enough of an evidence lol' and had to explain how overthrowing chandra (the antagonist. apparently a sadist (and misogynist ig) emperor from an imperialist lineage) can be. you know. a good thing. all this in the context where malini explains how one of her other imperial siblings, aditya is a good man and chandra is not. <input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"spoiler__control\" aria-label=\"The following text has been marked spoiler.

I was instantly immersed in the story and fell headfirst for Priya. (Also those arms!😍) <br /><br />The side characters, Bhumika, Ashok, Rao all had distinct voices and interesting backstories. The writing and dialogues are incredibly beautiful and I loved everything about this book. Also I cannot say how amazing it is to see names that are so familiar. It's indescribable. <br /><br />The worldbuilding is stunning and the plant based magic is *chefs kiss* I figured out that I'm a sucker for manipulation of plants! <br /><br />Malini and Priya's budding romance is the definition of Yearning.

It's too far away!!!!! <br /><br />Spies, lies, deceit, deadly sapphics and wer saris, this book has everything you need! And please tell me I'm not the only one who shipped Prem/Rao, my gaydar can't be broken.

      "review": "<b>Long story short:</b> This is a 10-12 hour story drawn out to 18 hours in which there's a lot of yak and not much happening. I like a good slow-burn story up to a point, but this went past that point for me. Also, if you're longing for a steamy F/F romance arc, <u>this ain't it</u>. I don't know what happens in the final third (because I quit), but just before that point, the two leads are barely even allies, let alone friends or anything more. On the other hand, if you want a story where the tension between the two romantic leads builds up at an agonizingly slow pace, maybe this is for you after all. If you don't mind it being very much a story about a rebellion brewing in a politically unstable place.<br /><br /><b>The long story:</b> Yet another female-centric fantasy story set in Eastern-themed lands that people love, and which I thought I would love, but which just didn't grab me. There's no single thing obviously “wrong” with this story, and yet at no time did I feel truly engaged by it. I checked my progress at the 1/3 mark, again at the ½ mark, struggled to get to the 2/3 mark, and finally quit just shy of 2/3. <br /><br />It goes on the same shelf in my mind as <a href=\"https://goodreads.com/book/show/32718027.The_City_of_Brass__The_Daevabad_Trilogy___1_\" title=\"The City of Brass (The Daevabad Trilogy, #1) by S.A.

People are gaga about these books, and yet they barely earned a lukewarm 3 stars from me. (To be fair, 3 stars is a “good” rating from me and means I liked it, but these were more like 2.75 or 2.5 rounded up.)<br /><br />Once I noticed this trend, I became worried that the problem might be ME – am I too racist to like fantasy stories that aren't filled with white people, set in a fantasy world based on western Europe, and full of traditional white-people fantasy tropes? But I did find enough counter-examples of stories filled with non-white people and in unfamiliar settings that I genuinely liked, without reservations, to ease the sinking feeling in my stomach: <a href=\"https://goodreads.com/book/show/41886271.The_Sword_of_Kaigen_A_Theonite_War_Story\" title=\"The Sword of Kaigen A Theonite War Story by M.L. Wang\" rel=\"noopener\">The Sword of Kaigen</a>, <a href=\"https://goodreads.com/book/show/19161852.The_Fifth_Season__The_Broken_Earth___1_\" title=\"The Fifth Season (The Broken Earth, #1) by N.K. Jemisin\" rel=\"noopener\">The Fifth Season</a>, <a href=\"https://goodreads.com/book/show/39395857.The_Raven_Tower\" title=\"The Raven Tower by Ann Leckie\" rel=\"noopener\">The Raven Tower</a>. <br /><br />The problem with Iron Widow was clear enough – it was chock full of all the reasons I tend not to like YA. The Poppy War and The City of Brass had some of that going on, too, although they aren't officially categorized as Young Adult. Kids going to special schools where they don't fit in and the other kids are mean to them. Heroine being in something that's threatening to become an Obligatory Love Triangle. That sort of thing.<br /><br />The Jasmine Throne, on the other hand, doesn't read like YA, and I doubt many people are going to confuse it with YA. The setting, major characters, and plot are all meaty, nuanced, introduced gradually, and will be hard to fathom for a while. Almost no one is quite who they first seem. The one character who's exactly what he seems is Emperor Chandra, who's just Super Bad. The setting is a fractious province that was forcibly annexed into Chandra's empire within living memory, its native religion brutally put down, and festering with dissent and terrorist activity that's gradually leading up to outright rebellion. The two main characters – the emperor's disobedient sister, who has been imprisoned in the burned-out temple of this remote place to teach her a lesson, and the native maidservant assigned to her – are both prickly and guarded, and at nearly the 2/3 mark are still cautiously dancing around each other, barely even allies, let alone friends or anything more. <br /><br />In theory, this is all delicious stuff, the makings of a truly good and engrossing story. But I never really felt it, and I felt it less and less the longer it went on. After noticing this and intensely scrutinizing what I didn't like about it, I think my problem with it is really a gestalt of numerous small issues: <br /><br />(1) It's very much a story driven by people's relationships with each other rather than about specific events and actions. One of the two main characters spends most of the book barely doing anything because she's too sick and weak, and the other main character spends a lot of time tending her. This leaves it a little short on action.<br />(2) There's too much writing here for the amount of actual story, and the parts of the story I wanted to know (like, what's going to HAPPEN?) were dribbled out too stingily among a lot of conversation scenes and flashback scenes that went nowhere and didn't advance the plot. <br />(4) You have to really want to get inside Priya and Malini's heads to get into this much delving and ruminating. In theory, I like a good character study, and Priya and Malini aren't NOT interesting, but they weren't interesting ENOUGH to support all this delving and ruminating... for me.<br />(5) Virtually every other character is under-developed and just flat-out boring. <br />(6) Writing that was fine and serviceable, and even unobtrusively good, but not impressive enough to make me forget points 1-5 and just enjoy riding the lazy river at the author's own speed.<br /><br />I read some of the 2-star reviews to see if they thought the same things I did, and YES, most of us down at this end of the scale are pretty much on the same page. On the plus side, the Hirana temple itself and the concept of it is quite nifty. And one reviewer pointed out, quite correctly I think, that Bhumika is arguably more interesting as a morally grey character than either Malini or Priya. She is a native who married the imperial governor and has to live with the fact that she literally sleeps with her people's oppressor every night, while she tries to help her people in her own small and secret ways."

Do you plan to read the sequel(s)?<br />I thought this was a well-crafted book. It wasn't one hundred percent my cup of tea, but I still think I'd give it a 4 out of 5. As others have said, it did feel like it dragged a bit in the first half, but I think that also gave us time to get a feel for the world and characters. I'm okay with a slow start especially when we're looking at three chonky books to really get through the plot and character development. So yeah, I will put the next books on my tbr.<br /><br />I'm definitely interested in all three of the religions and the magical underpinnings that seem like they might actually unite all three of them, and how the nature magic will work and how the magical beings (I'm sure there's some kind that's fire-related, too) will maybe re-appear or influence events. I enjoyed the India-inspired setting; I've read a number of non-Euro settings lately, but this is a new one to me. Other than Ashok, all our main characters developed (Priya) or showed more sides to themselves (Malini, Bhumika) as necessitated by the developing situations. The various strengths they all show are beautiful when they become able to/allow themselves to own their strengths - Bhumika's is probably my favorite as she keeps it so well-hidden for much of the book. They all walk thin lines between sacrifice and duty, personal desires, protective instincts; they all grasp for larger visions and struggle with the hard choices they have to make to gain those visions. To me, this all makes for a richly compelling read.<br /><br />The things I struggled with are things I struggle with in a lot of epic fantasy. Namely, a lot of people die and a lot of people are abused. Casually. Terribly. If I were a character, I would 100% be Aditya, trying to step outside the bloodbaths, knowing that being a pacifist is naive and yet wanting it to be true anyway. I read to find out what will become of these characters, but I also hate going through hell with them. Even though everyone in here is pretty morally grey, that makes them human, and I do think they all have a kernel of love that drives them inside of all that rage, of wanting to see a better world. It's super hard, at times, for me to relate to some of their decisions, but the fact that I can agree with their general instinct towards a better world makes it bearable. Complex politics are also frustrating to me sometimes and Malini is like 90% politics in her head.<br /><br />Also. I really really really hate fire. I had to sort of glaze myself and speed-read through bits so I didn't think too hard about it. I can see that this may be a problem in future books, too, but I'm still invested in the world/characters and wanting to see how things shake out.<br /><br />What are your final thoughts on the romance element?<br />Definitely not the usual take for a romance [leaving it undefined at the end], but it felt much more realistic to the way their relationship had been building than a clear-cut \"we have to end it\" or a dramatic pledge to be re-united one day. They know they can't promise getting back together, but they both know that their emotions have been too intense to eliminate that possibility.<br /><br />It was such a slow build and even though they spent a lot of time not trusting each other or their own feelings, it seems like with this \"ending\" they are finally acknowledging that no matter what use they may be able to make of each other for their own ends, they do actually have a deep connection that neither really wishes to jeopardize. I liked that their development was complicated and didn't just go right into passion getting in the way of goals."

The maid Priya, through complicated circumstances, becomes the maid of the imprisoned Malini to keep her company as well. At first Priya appears to be a kind-hearted person who wants to help the rotten children, but in reality her identity hides a person who holds a lot of power. And so Malini and Priya’s fates become directly intertwined.<br /><br />Why I wanted to read this series?<br /><br />I love exploring different cultures, so I thought The Jasmine Throne would be just right for me. I haven’t found an Indian setting in a book before, so I wanted to read this one even more. And since it is published by my favourite publisher Orbit, I knew in advance that it would be a very good book. That’s why I’m very happy that NetGalley confirmed my request and that I was allowed to read the book even before it was published. Nevertheless, I have already pre-ordered the paperback.<br /><br />These aspects attracted me the most while reading.<br /><br />Priya is fantastically integrated into the story at the beginning of the book, because in the very first pages, you realise that she is a woman of pure heart. She helps the poor who are struggling with a disease – the rot. So you notice right away what kind of personality Priya has. Her strength should not be overlooked, along with her good-heartedness. She is not characterised as strong in a masculine way, but has a strength that only a woman can possess. She is a rebel and fighter of her very own kind and therefore does not have to resort to masculine characteristics, as is often the case. It is nice to see that, in a certain way, a completely natural and normal woman can also be a fighter and that you don’t have to come across as arrogant and overly intelligent, but that you can also have heart as a strong main character. In many ways she reminded me of myself, which is why I was even more enthusiastic about her. She simply has a heart of gold.<br />Malini is also a very interesting woman, in her own unique way. In some situations, you can see that she is a princess and can also exercise a certain power. But I was particularly interested in Malini’s flashbacks and hallucinations. Through them you learn more about her history, the place where she grew up and also about her brother Chandra – the dictator brother. These flashbacks also show some other characters, who are of course not discussed in detail, but who show what life is like for the Paraijatdvipa. Also, through Malini, the feeling can be given that women have little to say in this world and especially through her cruel brother it comes out even more clearly. This of course reminds us of the stories of our times about the oppression of women, which of course can be established very appropriately in a fantasy setting.<br />Bhumika a woman of very different strength. I have to say that she was my favourite character, even though she may not be the most likeable character. She is tough, but fair. She sacrifices herself to achieve something greater and save her people. Through Bhumika, one can also experience the oppression of women, as she is the only one married to a man in this book. Even though her husband seems nice, he has different values than she does and thus she has no right to express anything “intelligent”. The author describes each of the three main female characters differently, so each has her own kind of strength and on its own very interesting personality.<br />The author has created a very mysterious but effective and authentic world here. It doesn’t seem to drift too much into typical fantasy world building, but it feels very real. All aspects of good world building are also used. Firstly, the religion dealing with the nameless god, the yaksa and the mothers of flame. And you also learn a little bit about the history and the political intrigues. Also, of course, the magic that has to do with the temple children, but I don’t want to give too much away here. These, however, somehow gave me a feeling as if it had something to do with Buddhism or Hinduism. The culture is what also shapes this world, of course through history and also through religion. But also the fact that the women here wear saris was something that gave the whole thing something realistic.<br />Readers of my blog know that I love political stories. And even though that is not the single focus of this book, I was not disappointed. On the one hand, the ruler who has undermined an entire population group who now have to fight for their continued existence. On the other hand, the oppressed women, who have hardly any rights in this world, are not taken seriously and in some respects are not even noticed. And lastly, the story also features the rebels. I always like stories that have to do with revolutions, because I can always empathise there. The hot blood that burns in the rebels always awakens a fire in me. <br /><br />So what are my final thoughts about it?<br /><br />I would love to spoil this book as there are so many exciting things happening, but of course I will NOT. So you will have to read the book yourself if you want to find out. There are so many secrets in this book that are revealed or just want to be revealed and so the book got more and more exciting towards the end. It has to be said that the characters are especially prominent here and they go through a great development. That’s why I’m eager to read more about each of them, because none of them seemed boring. Only in the first third of the book there are a few long stretches that bothered me at first, but towards the end of the book, it got more and more exciting and you couldn’t put the book down. A great start to this series and I am eagerly awaiting the next book!"

      "review": "This book was GREAT - I might boost my review to five stars, but I only give five stars to books that stay with me and it is very unusual for me to know a book will do that before time has passed.<br /><br /><br />I am really glad I didn't know too much about the book before I read it. I am pretty sure I got it out of the library because it was nominated for an award that I liked and had a pretty cover, criteria which often lead me to really bad books. But this one was very much the opposite and I am glad I read it with absolutely 0 context beyond what the text gave me. On those grounds, I suggest not reading any reviews or anything past this, and just picking up the book.<br /><br />However, if anyone has already read it and wants to know what I thought, I will share below.<br /><br />First, I really enjoyed the characters. Priya's arc felt like watching a flower unfold (a nice little meta layer of the story, considering the mythology of the world). Her basic goals were amazingly consistent, despite the upheaval in her world and her experiences. However the way she engaged with her world and goals changed radically, in interesting ways that surprised me (given my lack of any background about the book). She goes on a true journey of self discovery which I was very impressed by because normally books with that as am essential plot element are super boring or involve lots of travel to liven it up. Priya stays in just a few settings but by having her reconcile with her past, you get to see a tremendous amount of growth (pun intended).<br /><br />Malini was equally compelling by the end of the novel. I love fantasy politics and it is really refreshing to see a character who is comfortable with indirect ways to access power be at the center of a novel. It was also really interesting to see how she was deprived of power - drugging and isolating someone who is incredible at manipulation probably is the best/only way to address their power. It did make the early part of her story kind of boring, but also slow loss of the sense of self is really tragic, which kept me engaged enough. And seeing her interact with Priya at her absolute weakest really showed her brilliance. I love morally ambiguous choices and can't wait to see her face them in the next book.<br /><br />On a side note, I thought Pramila was great - she really made my blood boil as an excellent example of a character who wasn't a physical threat to the heroes but was still a really effective vilain. And she had a really interesting backstory, and raised interesting questions about how the roles we are in shape our beliefs and behaviors. Honestly close to perfect.<br /><br />Similarly, I don't have time to address Bhumika, but I loved her arc and how she thought about her roles, relationships and plans. She is honestly a perfect hero in my opinion, a pragmatic and self sacrificing character (sacrificing her pride and reputation, which I find the most impressive self sacrifices). I really look forward to seeing how her story evolves and whether her fears for the future are realized in later books (and how she addresses them!)<br /><br />I am also a huge fan of the world building/fantasy elements. As much as I like a single cohesive magic system (consider the Cosmere), I am a bit of a sicker for competing narratives about magic/divinity which ALL have some evidence. Ilona Andrews' Kate Daniel's is great for this, as the City of Stairs (I think that's the one) which deals with competing real pantheons directly. I really can't wait to see how it evolves/what we learn about the world and its religions in future books. <input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"spoiler__control\" aria-label=\"The following text has been marked spoiler. Toggle checkbox to reveal or hide.\" onchange=\"this.labels[0].setAttribute('aria-hidden', !this.checked);\" id=\"34ce4523-4160-4fc3-91c0-94598302ece9\" /><label aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"spoiler\" for=\"34ce4523-4160-4fc3-91c0-94598302ece9\"> I also can't wait to see how Priya's magic evolves. I have a feeling that her hollowing and the flower she gave to Malini will be very important </label><br /><br />Thematically, it is surprisingly appropriate. I read this in goodreads' romance week and while its an accident, I think it works really well. The love story between Priya and Malini was really beautiful, and worked really well on multiple levels. In the context of the story it adds a lot of tension (how will the love between princesses of uneasily allied states go?) And in the context of the emotional journey of the characters it made the story much deeper and intensified the love story. How can you love someone when you don't really know yourself, and don't trust anyone?<br /><br />My biggest issue with the book (and it was quite small considering the quality of the story) was with the villains. Chandra specifically just seems too typically evil. There are some common story beats in the Jasmine Throne (part of why I was so glad I didn't know anything about the book was it made these less obvious to me). But a sadistic emperor who kills for pleasure is so obvious at this point it is almost a cliche, and no level of blind reading could hide it. I really hope his character becomes more complex in the next books, especially given that all the other characters are so interestingly fleshed out. Ashok was a really great example of how the need for violence could be incorporated into a broader and more complex arc to make a really interesting character, though he is also partially redeemed. I hope that Chandra doesn't get left as an uncomplex sadist to provide Malini moral legitimacy as she wades through her own grey choices. <br /><br />Can't wait for the sequel.<br /><br />Read via the TPL"

      "review": "Solid four stars. Overall a good read, but there were a couple of demerits. <br /><br />I think the novel started it off a little shaky since the only thing maintaining my interest was the multiple POVs that revealed the untracked of the world. Also the romance between Malini and Priya was a little lackluster. I knew they were gonna get together before I started reading, but I just didn’t think there was enough development of their feelings for each other before the confession. When Priya confessed being attracted to Malini, it was like it came out of nowhere. The intensity of feelings was also seemingly unwarranted - especially since Malini didn’t seem to give two fucks about Priya in the slightest but then all of a sudden she’s burned for her all this time. <br /><br />This leads me to another gripe of mine. I don’t think it was intentional of the author, but I really hated how Priya (the explicitly darker-skinned) is almost immediately head over heels attracted to Malini (the explicitly lighter one) who is literally wasting away when they meet. Like Malini is canonically skin and bones and incredibly sick from constant poisoning, and yet she’s the one saying Priya is “unlovely” (multiple, multiple times)? Idk it kinda felt like some implicit bias that fairer-skinned people will always be more attractive than darker-skinned ones even at their worst. Considering how bad the colorism issue is in India, not to mention the rest of the world, I think that dynamic is something that should’ve been considered by the author and editors.<br /><br />After Priya and Malini got together, their relationship and all seemed fine. The thing that really carried this novel, apart from the world building, was Malini’s character. I love a good, and I mean really good, female anti-hero. The contrasts between her and Priya’s characters in addition to the relationship between them is very interesting and is perfectly setting up the inevitable conflict between them. The only thing that would’ve made it better is more development of the foundation of Malini and Priya’s romance since it is so integral to story. Without that strong foundation, you’re kind of left wondering what the big deal is with them."

      "review": "576 pages. I would be more generous with the rating if it weren't 576 pages.<br /><br />(also lol, what a surprise. Most of the fans aren't South Asians well-versed in their history or tradition).<br /><br />I feel bad when I read or watch anything that's been hyped all over the internet because I know some level of disappointment is inevitable. This is an attention economy and people need hype to pay their bills. But I feel worse for myself every time I think I've dodged the hype pitfall but realize I've wasted a whole day reading something that wasn't for me.<br /><br />The Jasmine Throne is hyped up all over the internet by young adults as a sapphic romance between two morally complex characters. If by morally complex you mean a natural desire for power (magic and throne), I guess? I saw no real moral greyness in either Priya or Malini. I thought both of them were frankly good noble people but the story and its fans genuinely believe that a justified desire for due revenge is a big deal. But also, when you actually live in South Asia, your bar for unacceptable is automatically higher. Yeah, one character tried to be manipulative. Anyone would, in her circumstances. Plus, it didn't even work! How do you expect me to be shocked at diet manipulation that FAILED???<br /><br />The story's world-building was so much more compelling than its characters that I only kept reading to understand the landscape. The most interesting character by FAR is Bhumika. I wish she had been the protagonist. Her story is clear and focused, allowing her characterization to shine. Then it's Ashok. I guess Rao is kinda decent? But his faith is so much more interesting than him. Aditya is an obvious Buddha rip-off. <br /><br />The buzz around the story was about the scandalous passionate romance between the two women - except there's little to no romance because both have separate arcs of their own that keep dragging them in two different directions. The political drama is ten times more intriguing than ANY of the paltry romance. So much of their 'closeness' is fleshed out in a memsahib and maidservant dynamic - with the story obsessively focusing on that, for some well-intentioned but ultimately disastrous reason - that it's not closeness, let alone love. It's two guarded girls who are understandably wary of each other and too busy focusing on their circumstances to fan the (mostly forgotten) crush into a proper flame. The passion also didn't simmer secretly either. It just wasn't there. All we got was the characters telling us they felt deeply for each other, but nothing to show for it.<br /><br />Priya is ten times more interesting when she's interacting with other temple children. The scenes with Malini are a snooze-fest. Similarly, the brief mentions of Malini's two friends revealed so much more about her than her (useless) performance around Priya. Priya and Malini are largely irrelevant as a dynamic in terms of impact on the story. I usually love stories with multiple perspectives and a big cast but this one had a very hard time making its characters memorable, maybe because it had such a massive vivid world to develop. For reference, I cry at the drop of a hat but when multiple - MULTIPLE - deaths happened, I felt nothing because they're supposed to be meaningful to Malini and Priya, and both of them have clear motives but clear motive does not a memorable personality make. Because it didn't really impact them, it didn't impact me. Also, the characters themselves weren't memorable either. <br /><br />Priya and Malini are specters, more meaningful as symbols than as people. Even the story is hooked on the maidservant symbolism in Priya and the China maal Razia Sultana symbolism in Malini. So imagine my irritation when I was lured in by the promise of a sapphic romance and only got a pointlessly drawn-out 'Bella, I'm a monster!' 'No, Edward, I know you!' back-and-forth between two symbols that could have been condensed in 2 pages. <br /><br />You want me to believe your two leads are compelling? Show me. I get to see Priya's power in action but all I get from Malini is everyone saying 'wow, she has lackeys everywhere!' and the only lackey I see is Priya, already renowned for being impressionable and trusting. I don't see ANY of Malini's influence or power in action because the story doesn't build her up. I don't see Chandra fear her, Aditya respect her, Rao venerate her for HER because they all have their own reasons for their relationship to her, not their recognition of her power. The story thinks it's sufficient to tell me she's influential but every time she exerts it, the person agreeing to her has a separate for acquiescing to her demand, rendering the instance ineffective. <br /><br />The story has multiple missed opportunities and dropped threads, which I guess are supposed to be elaborated upon in the next book. The series aspect means this book is not good as a standalone story. There are several people Rao meets that clearly won't be useful until later but have to be shoehorned in now. With serialization, the set-up in the first book is supposed to be useful in the same book AND to the series. It's not supposed to be one or the other. With Harry Potter, the Patronus and Buckbeak in Prisoner of Azkaban are relevant to Book 3 AND later. But this book is actually 250 pages of relevant storytelling and 300 pages of build-up for the next book. <br /><br />Maybe this would have been beautiful as a graphic novel. But for now, it's just 576 pages of a failed Nasuada and Murtagh/Zuko and Katara retelling. <br />To recap:<br />- The romance is WAY overblown<br />- The supporting characters are so much interesting than the leads (who are really not 'morally grey' at all)<br />- The world-building overtakes the characterization <br />- Serialization means you're swamped with irrelevant details that don't matter until later (by which time you've probably forgotten them)<br />- Priya and Malini are unformed specters <br /><br />If almost all of the world is from history and religion, strong complex characterization is then supposed to be the writer's unique contribution. Because this story's weakest point is precisely the hottest part of its marketing, it's better if you read a South Asian history textbook instead."

A south Asian inspired fantasy with a sapphic romance by a south Asian author with high ratings? I was SO excited. Honestly, I found all the characters to be lackluster, the romance to be underwhelming, the multiple POVs felt like they detracted from the story, and I really never felt like the story grabbed my heart in any way. I also saw a lot of reviews about the “morally gray” main characters but what exactly is morally gray about trying to do the best thing that makes sense to you for the greater good as you see it at that time? Just people who don’t know everything, if anything, but that’s not morally gray IMO. I also don’t like the cover for whatever that’s worth. The writing really did nothing for me, lots of repetition to the point where we probably could have cut out at least a hundred pages. Maybe epic fantasies just aren’t for us (and by us I mean my brain, my patience, and me) but yeah definitely fell short for me unfortunately. "

      "review": "Thank you NetGalley for offering me this ARC! <br /><br />The Jasmine Throne transports us too Ahiranya, a nation of magic and one plagued by a disease known as the rot. The nation is ruled by Malini's dictator older brother, Emperor Chandra. Priya, a maidservant, and Malini, a captive princess are forced together, and their destinies become irrevocably tangled. The story is filled with politics, religious beliefs, violence, and magic that create an extremely compelling and unique book. <br /><br />This was a beautifully written, and an extremely complex book that I was immediately thrown into from the very first chapter. I had little to no expectations for this book, and what hooked me from the start was hearing that it had two Lesbian Morally Grey leads. (who doesn't want a sapphic romance?) <br /><br />I think one of the most incredible parts of the book was the setting. I quite honestly don't think I've read a book with such an intricate and well developed world. The author does an absolute fantastic job of weaving Indian culture into the setting, although if I'm being completley honest I can imagine that it is a bit difficult to understand everything until you are completley immersed in the story. From the religions, to the magical elements, to the flawless cities and descriptions of everything that made this book so unique, I can argue that this is one of the most beautifully written books I've read.<br /><br />Where I had my biggest troubles with this book were the characters. The story follows our main leads, Priya, and Malini, but a few other POVS are added in as well, and I though it was all a bit overwhelming. With so many characters I found it extremely difficult to connect with them, if any at all, and I really think I would have preferred if this book was only 2 POVS. Priya was an interesting character enough, but Malini fell flat for me. I found her rather strange and felt as though there really wasn't anything special that I could relate to. <br /><br />The plot was interesting I can admit, but I did feel it was often extremely slow at times. I was able to eat up the beginning SO quickly because it was incredible, but the middle of the book was where things went down hill for me. I struggled to push my way through this book, (and a 500+ page book is not an easy feat). I think the entire thing really felt like a way to set up the plot for the second book. The majority of this book is spent around Malini escaping her prison, and Priya's brother trying to get her to work for him because of her abilities, and I couldn't force myself to be that interested in it. <br /><br />The romance was okay. Nothing special or overly enjoyable, but I can't go wrong with a sapphic romance. They had a complex dynamic filled with understanding, lust, hatred, (slow burn!!!). I can say that the romance did develop extremely naturally through this book, and it wasn't some insta love, or one that dragged on far too long. It was written well and realistically. <br /><br />I recommend this book for those who love High-Fantasy, especially an Indian-Inspired sapphic story! I definitely think it is worth the read, especially if you love books with extremely character driven story lines and complex characters.<br /><br />My final rating is 3.5"

Y’all I am proud to say it lived up to them. <br /><br />Sapphic Indian inspired fantasy. That was all it took to automatically make me love this. Everything else was just extra. <br /><br />Ok morally gray lesbians also did it. I’m multitalented. <br /><br />The amount of different povs felt a little unnecessary and a bit confusing at times. I could’ve done with just Priya and Malini. <br /><br />I loved both of their characters. I mean obviously they’re morally gray lesbians. <br /><br />I’m honestly in awe of Malini. She was willing to do absolutely anything to get her goal and I loved it. She’s ruthless and cunning and if she wasn’t as good at hiding her emotions I bet my left arm she would have a schemings face to rival Kaz’s. <br /><br />Priya was less cruel. More forgiving. She fought when necessary but wouldn’t hurt innocents. She wasn’t portrayed as weaker for this. She’s a different type of strong than Malini. A softer, subtler type. She believes in people, gives second chances, shows kindness to those who likely don’t deserve it. She’s what Malini needs in the book(?) to come to keep her from going to far. <br /><br />With romance between boss/employee, royalty/servant, etc I’m always worried about how the power dynamic will be addressed and dealt with. This handled it so well. They were both in power in separate ways and even while they were enemies they never treated each other like they were above them. <br /><br />The magic system was amazing. I love learning about the give and take of magic in fantasy worlds and this showed that. I can’t wait to learn more about the origin of the deathless waters and about Priya’s own past.<br /><br />The action was well paced and for all the book accomplished it didn’t feel rushed. The main couple had great chemistry and was amazing. I’m rooting for them. <br />You hear that Tashi? Let my girls be happy Please<br /><br />tl:dr if you hear morally gray lesbians or sapphic Indian inspired fantasy and think you’ll love it I promise you will. "

      "review": "The Jasmine Throne took some getting my teeth into due to it being steeped in mythology and magic. But once I was immersed into the empire, I was enthralled. I really enjoyed the different theologies of the Nameless God and the Mothers of flame. The natural magic of the Yaksa, putting Mother Nature at the forefront of wanting to tackle the man made patriarchy to the ground.<br /><br />Priya and Marlini are thrown together both desperately needing the other to achieve their ends. However, what they didn’t expect was their mutual attraction, it blazes from the page in the subtly of their jibes and quips. Their sapphic romance culminates in a few standout scenes that you wish lasted longer and leave you with just enough of a taste to want more. Together they seek to transform the empire and to take power from the tyrants and weak-minded men around them. My favourite character was Bhumika, finally a pregnant woman who is written with the fierce strength of a true protector. I loved her raw intelligence and how even after giving birth she is straight back into leading her people symbolising true feminine power.<br /><br />All of the characters are dripping in moral greyness which gives them sharp edges and throws you off being able to predict their next movements. The Hirana temple was so incredibly eerie and mysterious, home to the magical deathless waters that can both kill or grant magic, the temple moves and changes for its followers, shifting like the never ending staircase in Labyrinth. The book has the perfect antagonist with the cruel emperor and his obsession with burning women on the pyre to make them pure sacrifices. He is both tyrant, misogynist and spiteful, everything you love to hate him for. And that epilogue! Pure brilliance.<br /><br />I liked how every PoV that was given has a fierce sense of agency, every character was fighting tooth and nail to embrace their place in the struggle to take down the empire. No character was passive or watching helplessly from the sidelines, every character risks life and limb to see their vision become a reality. The ending is deeply satisfying, there is no leaving things unfinished or loosely hanging plot threads, everything is tied up nicely with the promise of epic movements still to come in the next instalment. There is no character loss for the sake of it as so often happens in epic fantasy. Every character arc is crafted to perfection and staged like the true epic myths and legends of old. The fact that women are integral to the success of the story is terrific and there are not many epic fantasies out there that show this level of female brilliance.<br /><br />Overall, The Jasmine Throne is evocative, lush and wildly intimate. You deeply connect with the characters and their motivations for change, until you are hoarse from cheering them on into the flames of the empire they are burning down."

      "review": "I absolutely loved this book. Like most fantasy it took about 100 pages to get into the world and the characters-especially because the author uses a lot of POVs, including some for minor characters for just one scene- but once you get used to it, the writing flows smoothly and it doesn't take any effort to keep reading. The book explores the effects of religion, nationalism, war, and revolution especially on children, and all the women characters were very different, and refreshingly unashamed of using their specific strengths to their advantage. <br /><br />The things I personally appreciated from this book were the explorations of different sibling relationships (especially how they are informed by childhood trauma), the South Asian culture, and (of course) the sapphic element.<br /><br />I would recommend this book for people who are interested in fantasy, South Asian culture, and/or morally grey sapphic characters.<br /><br />Word vomit spoiler section ahead:<br /><input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"spoiler__control\" aria-label=\"The following text has been marked spoiler. Toggle checkbox to reveal or hide.\" onchange=\"this.labels[0].setAttribute('aria-hidden', !this.checked);\" id=\"9dd49010-647b-4bab-805f-be30b911b146\" /><label aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"spoiler\" for=\"9dd49010-647b-4bab-805f-be30b911b146\"><br />I did not see that coming with Malini at the end, and I'm so excited and nervous to see just how dark she'll go (is she going to end up killing Aditya??). Once we saw that he didn't remember what Chandra did to her though I was pretty sure it wouldn't be cupcakes and roses between them.<br /><br />I also loved how the book illustrated the difference between kindness and niceness in Priya's character; she's so empathetic and compassionate with Rukh but is also like 'your newborn smells bad and her face looks old' what an icon<br /><br />I am so concerned about Sima, we didn't see much of her after the first few chapters and I'm worried she's going to be a kind of sacrifical/turning point death for Priya.<br /><br />As much as I love Priya and Malini together (and I do, a lot) I really like that they're both invested in their own sides. Like usually in enemies to lovers, once they get together the characters hold that above their committments to their nations but that's definitely not the case here and it makes for a much more interesting story that way.<br /><br /></label>"

I’ve been making sure to read my fair share of queer fantasy and boy did this pass the mark. <br /><br />The Jasmine Throne is an intricate fantasy novel filled with political intrigue, elite world-building, and wonderfully fleshed out characters set with a beautiful backdrop of historical India. Oh, and it’s GAY. <br /><br />Pros:<br />- Sapphic<br />- Strong female leads<br />- Rich world building<br />- Multiple interesting religions<br />- Indian characters and backdrop<br />- Morally grey, complex characters <br />- Really cool magic system<br />- Political scheming<br />- Multiple POVs<br /><br />Cons: <br />- A little long with slow pacing at the start<br /><br />Conclusion: read it. <br /><br />Thoughts:<br />I am not sure where to start describing my love for this book. We have QUEER enemies to lovers (yes yes yes), forbidden magic, morally grey characters, and such a rich backdrop of intermixed religions. <br /><br />I think that must be my favourite part. In The Jasmine Throne there are three (I think) main religions. The religion of “the mothers”, which is the prominent religion (and the one we know the least about funnily enough) of the empire, the religion of the nameless, where each person has a name which is a prophecy of their future (come on, how cool is that?), and the nearly extinct religion of the temple children/elders. The friction between these religions, PLUS the tyrant emperor, are the backing for the political unrest. <br /><br />Oh, and I’m OBSESSED with the three lead female characters, who are great examples of well written, complex, and immensely different characters. We have Priya, the kind yet powerful maid-servent with a big secret; Malini, the sister of the empress, who is determined to do whatever she needs to in order to help rescue the empire from her brother; Bhumika, the determined, level-headed, protector of those motherless.<br /><br />It also looks into some important topics like how religion can be manipulated by those in power to a means that is the opposite of intended. It looks into how women, even when not at the forefront, can be the heart of the mechanism. It looks into how those without power try to glean it back from the down-up. We also see how ruthlessness can be created both by desperation and by those in power feeling threatened. <br /><br />All in all, read it now.<br /><br />The reason for not being a 5 star is simply that I wasn’t a fan of the pacing at the start but that’s just my opinion.<br />"

I think a key part of it was the amount of time spent developing backstory characters without the depth of their identities. We learn about several different lands around Ashranyi but no details. Who are the Alori people? Who are the Dwarali? The book was a bit long winded to be lacking that richness.<br /><br />Things I loved about the book, the portrayal of women as authentic whole beings capable of murder, intrigue, and ruthlessness when it's called for. Women kicking ass and burying the men who seek to bury them. Overall, I enjoyed the book but I am not sure if I will be returning for book two. I always love sapphic representation however and we do get that."

I've read a good portion of the book and my mind just drifted to other things like the wind blowing outside my place or something. I'm one of those readers that get heavily swept up with when I read as if I'm a ghostly apparition observing and witnessing the events playing out in front of me but my attention felt more like moorse code while reading it. I'd say I got a third through and I still can't seem to get into it which is a real bummer because of the high praises and reviews of this book. I love fantasy sapphic and this book had everything I love but it just didn't click. I'm going to try and push through until halfway and if it still doesn't keep my attention, I'll have to call it quits. Nothing against the author and the book itself, I really want to like the book and it sucks I can't seem to love it like everyone else. It's like a joke everyone but you gets and finds it hilarious.<br /><br /><br />UPDATE: I finally finished the book and halfway through the book did pick up the interest factor, but I still wouldn't want to re read the book. It did introduce me to a new type of romance trope I didn't know I was missing. The crush to realizing the character is being used to hate to frenemies to love interest once again. Once again, my opinion has nothing to do with the fact that book material and the writing is trash or bad, it's good, it just didn't click with me. Glad I did finish the book mainly for the reason of being able to properly give my honest opinion of the book that I finished."

Just as I sought the deathless waters.\" </blockquote><br /><br />The Jasmine Throne is literally one of the best books I've ever read. It's not often that adult fiction series captures my attention as The Burning Kingdoms has. Morally grey sapphic characters in a high fantasy world with magic? Literally perfect. The book is a good mix of politics, inter-personal drama, and action. <br /><br />The Jasmine Throne is a truly epic high fantasy story that will leave you wanting to immediately read its sequel, The Oleander Sword. <br /><br />The world building is superb and fascinating. The cast of characters is lovable and diverse. I found myself falling in love with Malini and Priya. I wanted both of them to succeed (also Bhumika too). I would say the romance in the book is a medium-burn that feels authentic and realistic.<br /><br />For people who grew up reading Tamora Pierce, The Jasmine Throne is the book for you. <br /><br />Content Warnings: forced drug use, immolation, homophobia, familial abuse, violence, and death"

      "review": "My general thoughts on the book-<br />This book deserves a 100000 out of 5 stars. It’s amazing. World building? Well-built characters? Good representation? Sapphic romance? Amazing plot twists? Literally my favourite book? It has everything you’ll ever need.<br />Just stop reading the review right here. Just go ahead and read it. It’s an amazing book!<br /><br />My thoughts on the writing-<br />I quite liked the writing in this book. The action was well balanced with description and you could imagine everything that went on in the story. <br />The writing style at the start of the book is similar to We Hunt the Flame where they kind of just dive into the world and the characters talk about worldbuilding during action scenes. For example, Priya talked about the Hirana and the dead children; in We Hunt the Flame Zafira talks about the Arz and the depletion of magic. This writing style wonderfully aids in world-building, by making sure that they are not just listing facts but the parts of the world building that the characters are talking about, are actually useful in that scene. Thus, giving us an example of that aspect of worldbuilding, making it easier for the viewer to remember it. <br /><br />My thoughts on the plot- *SPOILERS*<br />I loved the progression of the plot and especially the end, where Malini’s prophecy is read out and it turns out that she is destined to be empress. I personally loved Bhumika’s POVs out of all the other ones since they were quite interesting. These POVs were near the end of the book but it really showed you Bhumika’s inner turmoil and how she was always caught between two ends. I also liked that one moment of vulnerability Bhumika had shown Vikram and she had talked about how, even if her marriage was a marriage of convenience, she had a small flicker of hope and love for him. I loved her character a lot and how carefully layered she was. <br />Overall, I have to say that this might be one of my best reads of 2021.<br />I almost threw the book at the wall when I realised book 2 wasn’t out yet."

But I agree with previous reviewers that the male PoVs were underdeveloped (the most interesting and complex male character, Aditya, did not get to narrate); for me, this gave the book a stop-start feel, as the pace slowed to a crawl whenever a male character took the stage then sped up again when a female character returned. It's also overlong, especially towards the end, when an obvious 'reveal' is dragged out for all it's worth, and I never really believed in the romance between Priya and Malini, much as I love lesbian representation. I'm not sure whether or not I'll be motivated to pick up the next in the series, especially as I enjoyed the first half of the book more than the second. 3.5 stars."

You did not have to tell me anything else. I'm just a girl. <br /><br />Set in a world inspired by the history and epics of India, in which captive princess Malini and a maidservant Priya who is in possession of forbidden magic become unlikely allies on a dark journey to save their empire from the princess's traitor brother.<br /><br />This was absolutely gorgeous writing and story-telling. This world has been so carefully crafted lovingly woven together with amazing complex women at the center of it. <br /><br />What I especially loved in the romance is that these were two women who are so powerfully strong on their own that when they come together it's like watching two flames erupt into a blaze. They both have grown up in a patriarchal and homophobic society so they know what it's like to live under someones thumb. So when it comes to romance they both have better things to do but can't help the undeniable yearning between them. (Yes I am planning on overthrowing the empire I'm fully booked but also maybe hold my hand longer).<br /><br />The character work done on Princess Malini and Priya was amazing to read. Priya being a soft hearted person who can't help but try to save everyone after watching her whole family die and Malini who has lived her whole life in fear of her older brother and now will finally get the revenge she's always wanted. I mean you get the best of both worlds here and the most delicious of tension and political complications.<br /><br />\"Oh, you're so lovely to me, you're very good at being lovely, but you're also the woman who organized a coup against the emperor. You're deep waters, Malini. You're so much more than you're willing to show me, and that scares me. I think I'm always waiting for you to turn on me.\"<br /><br />Along with the two main characters you get other multiple pov's which at times I felt conflicted because while I do enjoy knowing how everything plays out I also do love the mystery and suspense of not knowing what other characters might be thinking/plotting. For that reason I took off half a star. Otherwise the other characters were amazingly developed and distinct in their own story-telling and I enjoyed every single one!<br /><br />I kind of guessed some stuff about the ending so it wasn't as powerful for me but it still definitely got me pumped to continue the rest of this series. The way things left off for Malini and Priya is complicated and so I am EXCITED for some conflicted tension next book because I love to suffer!!"

I was more invested in the side characters’ than the main characters’ stories. <br /><br />One of my qualms with this book is the insta-love cliché between the two main female characters. They’re supposed to be enemies. I think there’s a difference between interest/desire and love, and all of it developed too fast to be believable. This actually killed any tension that some other readers may have devoured. Most of the tension I felt was the characters’ anger and anguish towards the status of their world. I wanted more of this, and a lot more development in the romance in order to be on board with how fast it developed. <br /><br />At times the story lost my interest, and at others, I was devouring it. I will read the sequel, but I’m also okay not reading it. I think I just need time before I take on the next one. "

      "review": "The Jasmine Throne is a new fantasy epic set in a world inspired by the history and epics of India and featuring not one but two morally gray complicated women at its center. Malini is the sister of an evil emperor. He has gone all sorts of religious crazy. When she refuses to burn herself alive to satisfy his zeal, Malini is sent away to the newly conquered kingdom and locked away in an old haunted temple until she complies with his demands. Meanwhile Priya who eventually becomes assigned to Malini’s handmaiden has secrets and problems of her own. The temple that is now Malini’s prison was the sight of a horrific massacre of the temple children—a death by immolation that Priya only survived by chance. Re-entering the temple awakens her long dormant abilities. <br />When Priya witnesses to these abilities, their relationship to one another is forever changed. <br /><br />Rounding out the POVs are Ashok, Rao and Bhumika and a couple other characters that only have one POV section. Each has a different relationship with the empire, with faith and with each other. There are three different religions practiced in this world, with magical abilities and side effects tied in. The world feels rich and deeply realized. <br /><br />The biggest strength of the novel is the way each of the characters has their own goal and morality sometimes in conflict with one another, but not always. As a result, relationships are changing and characters evolve significantly as to what actions they are willing to take and where they cross the line. The best part is the bond between Malini and Priya which is at times sympathy, friendship, manipulation, rivalry, and as both are queer women, love and attraction. The power between them shifts a lot too, and I suspect that might be a through-line throughout the series. <br />"

The complex, morally grey, queer heroines, the lush fantasy setting and the themes of resistance to name a few. <br /><br />I really wish the author had not included the points of view of the secondary characters, this really slowed the reading process for me as I just could not be invested in them, despite my best efforts. While Malini is endlessly fascinating, and you can't help but root for Priya, the other P.O.V. characters were lacklustre. Bhumika was interesting, and I enjoyed her arc, but I really couldn't tell you anything about the others as they were much less developed... or potentially because I resorted to skim reading their chapters.<br /><br />The pace was also a little slow, but it did eventually ramp up to an exciting conclusion. At this stage, I'm glad I gave it a go, it was an enjoyable read, but I'm unsure if I will continue with the next instalment in the series. <br /><br />If you like a slow-burn romance, a sumptuous fantasy setting, ancient magic, rebels and resistance, and don't mind multiple points of view (some of which may or may not be compelling to you), then this is worth a look. <br /><br /><br />"

Where did the rot come from? What happened to the temple children? THEY BURN WOMEN?<br /><br />I was so completely invested in Priya and her family drama and the temple children that the romance actually kind of snuck up on me, it's a pretty minor part of the plot compared to all of the other INTRIGUE that's happening (the politics! The magic! There's so much politics) and that almost never happens to me. I'm so here for it though.<br /><br />I also love how women centeric, queer centric, and non-Western centric this whole story is. Extremely South Asian society oriented, from the magic to the religion to the outfits to the food (it's fabulous), and the men... don't shine. It's very Game of Thrones in terms of vying for power and complexity and everyone is trying to kill each other, but think GOT if the showrunners didn't hate women.<br /><br />I listened to the audiobook and the narration is excellent, even though it's incredibly long at almost 20 hours, I enjoyed every minute of it.

She could be a creature born of poison and pyre, flame and blood.”</i>\n</b><br /><br />This book starts out with fire and it does not die down throughout the story. Princess Malini, traitorous sister to the Parijati emperor refuses to burn and is sent instead to be imprisoned in the conquered nation of Ahiranya where unrest and tensions are rising. Masked rebels are taking more and more violent action to free themselves from Parijatdvipa’s control, aspiring to revive the legendary powers of the temple children of the Hinara. Priya is a simple servant working at the Regent’s mahal with a gentle heart, or so it seems. As appearances are shattered and secrets unveiled, Malini and Priya cross paths and find an ally in each other.<br /><br />Their relationship is a complex one where they’re not beyond using each other but are slowly learning to trust. Both of them are strong and ruthless in very different ways and it shows in their progressing dynamic too. Ultimately they find comfort in understanding each other’s harsher nature and actions perfectly and without judgement and find softness together.<br /><br /><b>\n  <i>“We didn’t deserve what was done to us. I want to believe that. I want to know that. I want that to be true, and if it isn’t, I want to make it true. But you, Malini, you want to remake the world.”</i>\n</b><br /><br />Priya and Malini also share their trauma with each other and find solace in understanding that too. They’ve both been abused by their families and have deeply painful experiences linked to fire but their coping mechanisms are very different. Priya has shut her childhood trauma out by refusing to remember her own memories of the temple burning which also blocks her connection to the Hirana and her powers. Malini is still reeling from recently seeing her heart sisters burn while she refused to go to the pyre, having drugged induced hallucinations where she feels she deserves their hatred.<br /><br />This book explores how these two girls have had their humanity ripped away by circumstances and how their brothers have shaped them into weapons, whether it be intentional or not. Both are longing for something greater than survival and meeting each other might be the first step in embracing every part of themselves.<br /><br /><b>\n  <i>“There was no void in her any longer. Whatever she was- weapon, monster, cursed or gifted- she was whole.”</i>\n</b><br /><br />The author does not shy away from exploring the dynamics of toxic and abusive families and the different shapes they present themselves in. Both Malini’s blood brother and Priya’s temple brother (and just temple siblings in general) are two sides of the same coin but the feelings Malini and Priya still feel towards them are very different. It is handled in a careful and layered way that explores this abuse but also discusses what family can be. We slowly discover what this temple family means to Priya, who they were, and why their love was found in pain and pain found in love. <br /><br />While misogyny has a fierce grip on this world, Priya, Malini and Bhumika all know their own power. They understand the power of being underestimated and how to use that, manipulating the circumstances for themselves in their own ways.They’ve all made sacrifices for power and know its price maybe better than anyone else. Their strengths lie somewhat in their pain and the things they’ve endured, but Priya’s might be her unfailable kindness. The author will never let you forget that despite the circumstances she has not turned her back on others and has managed to build meaningful relationships, even with all the lies. Seeing her relationship with her friend Sima and Rukh warmed my heart so much and those were never presented as weaknesses, but a core part of Priya’s character.<br /><br /><b>\n  <i>“Some men dream of times long dead, and times that never existed, and they’re willing to tear the present apart entirely to get it.”</i>\n</b><br /><br />While on opposing sides of this building conflict, Chandra, Emperor of Parijatdvipa, and Ashok, the rebels’ leader, both aim to restore older powers and recall a past long dead. Chandra abuses the faith of his people in the mother of flames to see women and countries burn, being purified by fire and so-called raised to “immortality”. He plays a ruthless game of conquest, seeking to eradicate other religions and cults to impose his own. The Ahiranyi used to worship the yaksa (tree-like entities that hold power over nature) and the temple children and elders used to be conduits for this power. However this always came at the cost of surviving the deathless waters. Their temple was burned and their faith squashed down by the Parijati but Ashok aches to restore their once great powers to free Ahiranya.<br /><br />Other faiths are also explored in very interesting ways in this book. For example, Alorans worship the nameless god and their names are a prophecy given at birth that isn’t to be spoken to anyone else until it feels like the right tile. Although this latter religion was not discussed as extensively as the other two, it still plays a pivotal part in the plot of this book and brings in a third, seemingly more balanced, perspective. <br /><br /><b>\n  <i>“Even when we try to explain a vision of ourselves to one another - in our poetry, our song, our theater masks- we do so in opposition to you, or by looking to the past. As if we have no future.”</i>\n</b><br /> <br />The waning of Yaksa power brings not only a layer of magic to this fantasy world but a tangible and easy to grasp effect of Parijati imperialism in Ahiranya. It truly shows what it means to crush not only a country but its people and their culture. It is felt in the loss of their powers and traditions, in a new religion being imposed on them. It can be seen with the loss of their language to the point where only a few words cling to the edges of their daily conversations. A conquered nation is not only conquered territory, it’s a whole history being rewritten and a people losing every piece of their nation.<br /><br />There is no arguing that Chandra is an awful and terrible person at heart and that his ways are extreme, but it’s also shown that imperialism is deep-rooted and a bloody heritage passed down through generations. Others have come before him and conquered nations for him to rule, he is not an exception but the heir to a long line of oppressors. <br /><br />The Ahiranyi hold on to the last of the powers that they have: words and art. While Ashok’s group takes decisive and bloody action, others are rebelling through poetry and dance, telling the stories of these rebels, and keeping spirits of the people up, trying to instill some hope into them.<br /><br /><b>\n  <i>“Parts of me are broken and I stand in the middle of all those pieces and don’t go anywhere. I’m stuck. In all this time, I’ve just been quiet.

      "review": "The start had me hooked with the intrigue and lush world building and then it went down hill!!<br /><br />📖 An Indian Inspired Epic Fantasy following a vengeful princess seeking to depose her brother from his throne and a priestess searching for her family.<br /><br />Together, they will change the fate of an empire.<br /><br />✨ Review ✨<br />Let's start with what I loved and that's the world-building. The world itself was gorgeous and rich with culture. The authors prose created such beautiful imagery it was really easy to just fall into this world.<br /><br />I also think this had a really strong start, the prologue alone gripped me and then we are introduced to our characters and to start with I really liked them. But the more I read the blander they became. They were lacking depth and I felt reveals for character motivations and ARCs came to late. Things just felt like they were in the wrong order. It's missing the emotional impact.<br /><br />I love multiple POV but there are to many throw away POVs and the chapters are so short I don't think you sit with anyone long enough to ever get a true sense of them.<br /><br />We would also have these big build ups to things and as beautiful as the writing is I feel they are unnecessarily dragged out. And then in the end these moments would fall flat. Multiple times I sat here like 'well that was anticlimactic' <br /><br />The pacing is messy and so off. It made reading this a struggle. Little things are dragged out, big plots points are rushed. For a massive chunk of the middle it felt like we had pressed pause on everything. We were dancing around the same couple questions. Nothing was moving forward and it's not like there was character development going on. The story was stuck in every way.<br /><br />The romance is a very small subplot and I like that they have there own things going on but when they came together it didn't make sense to me and it felt forced and unnecessary. Like the building is on fire, there is a battle going on outside and they are arguing about how they want eachother.<br />1. Since When, what? I'm confused!!<br />2. Can we do this another time! <br /><br />The plot itself is really interesting but again dragged out and I think we are missing motivations for some big players. It's a lot of tell and little show. <br /><br />The world is lush the intrigue is there but the more I think about this book the more I don't think I wanna carry on with this series."

      "review": "This is my review for book club<br /><br />I will first take this moment to tell you all, I told you so. I have been pushing for the Jasmine Throne for months and guess what? It’s great! I know, you can all thank me later with cash and iTunes gift cards. This definitely isn’t a scam or anything.<br />Anyway, the Jasmine Throne is a great first entry into the Burning Kingdoms trilogy. It has some great characters, interesting worldbuilding and of course romance. Let’s start with the things I like. <br />The biggest plus and the thing that I always respond to is great characters. A few standouts to me are Bhumika, Rao, General Vikram and of course Priya. General Vikram I thought was a well-written antagonist who was multi-faceted and you really feel sympathy for someone who is ultimately irredeemable. Rao is just a character-type I enjoy, the morally gray fake fool. I think that with most of the characters being so well written, it highlights that Ashok falls flat for me. He just seems like a lazy example of the villain with a tragic backstory but there’s really no dimension to his character for me other than he “does what must be done”. Priya has complicated feelings about him and his followers seem to revere him but I don’t ever get the sense that he shares the same sentiment other than the author telling us he does. <br />The worldbuilding was great. Love me some fantasy religions and gods and how the different characters in a story revere them or despise them or what they think about the people who worship them. The Nameless god is a standout for me that I thought was incredibly creative and fascinating. Oh? Everyone who is born into this religion is given a prophecy as a real name? I would like to know more please! The Deathless waters I thought were a really interesting way to introduce magic into the world and it makes me wonder if there are other sources of magic in this world that give other people powers too. <br />The romance I enjoyed but I think was missing something. Once Priya and Malini had feelings for each other, it was captivating to see them struggle with it and how their love for one another grew and the decisions they made as a part of it. But getting there at least in the beginning was hit or miss for me. Priya is told by multiple people that Malini is this cunning manipulator and Priya struggles in the first half with how she feels and if Malini actually feels the same about her or Malini is making Priya feel this way on purpose to get something from her. I think that tension is lessened by the fact that Malini is a POV character. While Priya struggles with her feelings, I knew where both characters were at so there was no mystery or tension. And I think there’s supposed to be a betrayal where Priya accuses Malini of being this social manipulator and it’s supposed to be a really intense scene but I have the full picture, I know where both characters are at so it fell flat for me. <br />However, these are nit picks. I enjoyed the book overall and the last half I loved. Everything in this book was at least good at a minimum and fantastic for certain characters and themes. I am so excited for The Oleander Sword which I hopefully get for Christmas. 4.5 stars. <br />"

      "review": "Holy shit, this book SLAPPED. It's been such a long time since I read a book with such strong Indian rep, and Lemme say, picturing Priya and Malini in saris hit differently. It was also fun imagining Bollywood as the cast.<br /><br />While Ive read fantasy before, I find it hard to fully invest in the story because the world building can be complicated, and the relationships can be so intricate that it's hard for me to understand. However, this book's prose was elegant, but simple, and it not only made the world easy to understand, but it just felt SO rich. <br /><br />I honestly didn't love the ending, because it laid the groundwork for the sequels. But the representation, the world building, and the romance makes this a five star book for me. I only want to read about India now ❤️"

      "review": "I really enjoyed reading this Indian mythology-inspired adult fantasy. The world feels so authentic and unique. In fact, the world in combination with an extremely accessible writing style and morally grey characters narrates a story which is both immersive and entertaining.<br /><br />The story is told through multiple POVs but the two main characters are Malini, who is an exiled princess and Priya, who has been appointed as Malini's maid servant, while Malini is imprisoned in an ancient temple of Priya's people. I loved both these ladies, they are completely different from each other but both of them shows so much strength and courage when facing such bleak situations. However, I would have really liked if their romance underwent some more development. The author has left things pretty much open at this point so I would love to see how it goes in the future books but I wasn't really onboard with the romance in this one.<br /><br />There are other significant characters such as Ashok, Bhumika and Rao whose POVs we get and I really liked seeing the world and story unfold through so many varied characters with such varied values and ethics. <br /><br />Overall, this is a story of rebellion and oppression as much as it is of Magic. I loved how seamlessly the author combined the two in the narrative. I loved seeing the opposing views on rebellion and how it must be carried out and I loved the twisted relationship that existed between different characters. I look forward to seeing how the story will progress.<br /><br /><i> ARC received via Netgalley! </i>"

      "review": "This was a very interesting concept of fantasy. In a way, it reminded me of Game of Thrones, for the roles politics and religion played on the plot, some common themes about power. Yet it wasn't like anything I've read before. Quite a unique magical system (and unique imagery), and the stories of three very interesting women that find power in a world of men. <br /><br />The Jasmine Throne tells the story of Malini, sister of the emperor, imprisoned after she refused to burn herself alive as a sacrifice for him, and Priya, a made with a secret past and a secret power. Later, a third character, a woman who married for power and to keep her country safe, gains importance. She might not receive as many chapters in her POV as the other two, but to me, she was the most impressive, for all the things she did while pregnant. <br /><br />The characters are unique, each with her own story, personality, wishes, and challenges. They are united in the way each of them has been hurt by men, but they each had their own answers to that hurt. The things they want are completely different, and it is what carries the story. <br /><br />The biggest strength of this novel is the worldbuilding. The author paints small details that made me feel that I could visualise this world, live inside it, and experience it like I was there. The characters, too, were interesting, as I've said before. And the author also offers a lot of food for thought with the themes she chooses: how do you react to being hurt? What is worth killing for and what isn't? What's the cost of power? And most importantly, what are people willing to sacrifice in the name of power?<br /><br />The book includes a saphic love story. There are no steamy details, the intimate scenes are fade to black, the focus being more on feelings. I liked that the author also touched the subject of being gay in a world where it is forbidden, of feeling like there's something wrong with oneself. I'm straight and happy enough to live in a time and place where I could express myself even if I wasn't, but I know what it means to hide parts of me, and the way the character felt resonated with something within me.<br /><br />As a conclusion, I would say this is a good fantasy book. I recommend it especially to those who like to read about politics and power dynamics, and of course, to those who wish to read about strong women."

      "review": "**ETA: DISCLAIMER, I read this book as an audiobook and upon reflection, the narration was incredibly flat with no variation between characters and minimal dynamics in reading. This is VERY likely to have negatively impacted my review. I will probably try reading the physical book prior to the sequel coming out and re-review. I do not recommend this audiobook:** <br /><br />3.25 stars for this first book in the Burning Kingdoms Duology. <br /><br />The imagery in the book is spectacular with the depictions of the rot, the way it grows in people, the deathless waters and the process of becoming reborn. You can practically smell the jasmine and feel the thick wet heat of the world they exist in. <br /><br />However, what fell flat for me were the characters themselves. They were intentionally written as morally grey, which is not a problem for me. I love a morally grey character. There was just never any reason to care about them as individuals. The romance between Malani and Priya felt forced rather than lived. Meaning it felt like the characters were interested in each other because the author said they were but there was no written connection/reason why. Other than Priya was just drawn to her. It felt inauthentic. <br /><br />Unfortunately the characters also were, for the most part flat/lacking in personality as well and that made it hard to care about what happened to them in the end. The only characters who stood out were Bhumika and Rukh, and they are relatively minor characters. Malini does develop and improve as the story goes on, but Priya largely remains flat. <br /><br />I believe if the interest in the characters had been better established and their personalities better filled out (delaying the “action” in the beginning) I would have been more invested in their story and overall would have enjoyed it more thoroughly. <br /><br />In the beginning I felt like this book would be a cross between Priory of the Orange Tree and An Ember in the Ashes, but by the end it felt like a watered down version of the least interesting parts of both books. Will I read the next book? Maybe. Would I recommend this to a friend? Probably not."

      "review": "Malini is a princess but is imprisoned by her own brother for not sacrificing herself as he wanted. Priya is a maid in a noblewoman's household and is given the task of making the journey to Malini's prison every evening to clean her chambers. But when something unexpected and terrifying happens, Malini witnesses a hidden strength in Priya and decides that the two of them must ally to right the wrongs of the empire.<br /><br />This was a masterfully written work. The prose and writing style of the author were easy to read and engaging but not oversimplified. The characters were well written overall. Priya and Malini both had great character development and growth throughout the work. The remaining characters felt a little bland though - not enough to majorly detract from the work, but it made reading the chapters from their POVs much less interesting. There was a large cast for this work that was difficult to keep track of at first, but there's a list of characters in the back of the book that helps. I liked the idea of the romance between Priya and Malini, but it didn't feel quite right - I'd say it was the only part of their characters that didn't feel well developed and felt like it didn't belong, which was disappointing.<br /><br />The worldbuilding was well done, and I enjoyed how much nature was incorporated throughout the story. The religious aspects that were included and how differently it affected the characters added much to the story, especially in relation to one's true name and how it prophesies your fate. On a related note, the theme of fate and whether or not it is set in stone or even exists was interesting, and the way different characters responded to the concept added depth to the work. <br /><br />This was a great work of fantasy inspired by the Indian culture. I highly recommend it to lovers of fantasy!"

The setting and worldbuilding are very strong in this first book. We're introduced quickly to the rot, a disease that slowly turns people into plants before killing them, and the mysterious magic of sacred wood and the deathless waters, magic of a country that has been subdued and is no longer allowed to even practice their culture, let alone their magic. <br /><br />The two main characters Priya and Malini are both written well, though characterization overall if where this book begins to fall a bit flat. The story of our main characters is deep and compelling; Priya an orphan from the temple of the Hirana who was supposed to become a magic user, and Malini a princess sent to be isolated and imprisoned for daring to go against the wishes of her brother the Emperor. Barring these two characters many of the other side characters do not get a whole lot of fleshing out. We get some recurring characters and several very small POVs throughout, and it became a little difficult to tell them apart due to most of the other characters seeming pretty much the same. This definitely may be something that improves in the next book, but needed some work here. <br /><br />I also want to mention is that despite what some other reviewers have been saying, this is not a romance book. There is romance in this book, yes, but it's never made the focus and doesn't ever feel forced or really thrown at you to pay attention to. This is the story of an Empire filled with different factions reaching for power, the clash of differing religious beliefs, and yes, a romance that two women find along the way. I know romance tends to tell, but I think labeling this as a romance vs. Fantasy with romantic elements among other things is really selling it short. <br /><br />Now the last thing I want to talk about is writing suspense/mystery and/or a twist. However you classify it, it's always going to be annoying when an author tries to have something be a big reveal, but it was blatantly obvious what the reveal was going to be. This happens with a couple of events toward the end where there are several mentions of something being revealed and it's very evident what is going to take place, making the idea that it's supposed to be mysterious and a big reveal nearly come off as condescending. <br /><br />Despite my few complaints on this book, I did enjoy this book and think it shows a lot of promise for the rest of the series. There are definitely some areas for improvement, but the world that was built here is definitely one that I'd like to revisit."

      "review": "<b></b><br /><br />Chanced upon this in, of all places, a scifi bookstore in Sweden and was highly excited at the idea of a fantasty writer of Indian origin who has crafted a fictional world that draws from the world of South Asia - a place that has a vast and vivid pool of stories and ideas to draw from but I feel has been quite unable to break out of its own hardened molds.<br /><br />THE BOOK:<br />The narrative is a relatively simple and possibly familiar one - which in and of itself is fine. We have two principal characters - Priya and Malini - who are respectively a palace serving maid and a princess of the most powerful empire of the known kingdoms. The Emperor is by all accounts, a despotic ruler who asserts his power through the use of fear and cultural+religious dominance as his primary tools (which I must admit, rang troublingly true to a lot of the world today) and his sister is a problem that he cannot kill outright and so he imprisons. Priya meanwhile has a history that even she seems unable to remember (traumatic amnesia?) that is directly related somehow to the Hirana temple wherein the princess is imprisoned and much of this book is Priyas journey to finding herself and to her and Malini finding each other and helping one another to break free of their prisons - be they literal or metaphorical.<br />There are several supporting characters like Bhumika, the Regents' wife who shares a history with Priya that is somewhat secret for a while at least. Ashok, the leader of the rebels with his own connections to and motivations regarding the Hirana and the power hidden within. There are also the Princes Rao and Prem who are playing their own part subtly in the inter-kingdom intrigues that bubble under the surface of this first book in the series.<br /><br />MY THOUGHTS:<br />So that's the bulk of the books story without spoiling anything really noteworthy. As to how I felt about it, well rarely have I read a book that has me so drastically split in my own opinions on its pros and cons.<br />For starters, there is no question in my mind that this is a highly imaginative book because it takes a bold chance crafting a fantasy paradigm that veers clearly away from the almost painfully familiar Judeo-Christian, northern-European-ish, Tolkien-esque tropes and Oriental-cliches that are the fantasy mainstays. It crafts the basics of a believable world that draws from the food, clothing, culture and mythos of much of South Asia - from the sarees to the way the people behave to the existence of a caste-like social division to the more fantastical elements like the Yaksa's that are familiar to Sri Lanka. It is a world of potential and one I found quite engaging, though it was for me personally, not explored near enough for a 500+ page novel and a lot of it felt like it was teased or just skimmed, like it was explored only to the extent that served a purpose for the story or for the authors desire to describe a thing; this would be where my gripes with the editors of the book come into play.<br />The editing in the book feels ineffective. I don't mean grammatically, that's all fine. But there were far far too many instances where the prose ran on describing or over-describing things that felt like they could easily have been pruned, others where we don't get enough information and there are some flaws in the world-building itself that could perhaps have been addressed with a keener eye from an editor or Beta reader. To put it another way: there was too much of the book where my attention was sliding away from the page, only drawn back by the core ideas that were decent and my own curiosity to know what happens.<br />Back to the story! The narrative is not too complex and fairly predictable at times for a fantasy adventure+romance, but on the whole it's got enough positives to keep you curious about what happens. After what I felt was a slow start that I had to push through, it became far more engaging once the basic pieces were in place and some of the more supernatural elements came into play and the actual plots began to roll. The real challenge came as we got to the end, because this is the first novel in a series and that can be challenging - this one had a good ramp-up to get to that finale but I felt it fell short. It's like the pieces were all there but with some re-arranging, some adjustment to the choices made and it would have been fine. As it is, I found it to be more bland and like a firecracker that fizzles.<br />A core challenge for me was that the main duo is not nearly as engaging as the author seems to think they are - Priya and Malini both suffer from being both over-described and at the same time, under explored. They seem a little limited in their dimensions and while some growth is there, it feels again, oddly shallow. On the other hand, Bhumika comes almost out of nowhere and became by the end my favourite character and one that we could even with the limited space given to her, having depth and nuance and growth - as also with Ashok, who is not a terribly innovative or complex villain, but he has at least a somewhat understandable motivation and character and he feels real. In effect, for me the supporting characters all felt more interesting and I actually ended the book almost wishing Bhumika had been the lead character. Even the dynamic that is dwelled on time and again between Malini and Priya felt like something out of a Y.A novel, a bit on the teenage/angsty and over-wrought side.<br />The other challenge for me was the world-building itself. As mentioned before, there is a nicely crafted base on which the author has built her story, but it suffers from being at times not explored enough for my liking - perhaps it was a choice to try and keep more mystery for the future installments but as a first book in a series, for me it left too many questions that could have easily been fleshed out a little more and if the choices had been made to perhaps prune back the aforementioned fluff and substituted with this kind of descriptiveness instead, the whole book might have been the richer and more engaging as a result. <br /><br />There is a very nice world and a good book in here - but the bottom line for me was that I am deeply torn. There is enough skill in the author and more importantly, in her imagination, that I want very much to enjoy this world and know what else there is to it all, but the flaws in this book, the characters and the admitted effort I had to put to push through parts of it make me wonder if I'll even try the next."

      "review": "UPDATE 25.02.2022<br /><br />I wanted to comment on some negative reviews I have seen that irked me, which say this book is \"too YA\" because the characters are not morally grey enough. Beyond my having a personal pet peeve about people who claim an adult book is \"too YA\" or that a YA book is \"too adult\" as if rigid lines can be drawn around these genres that ultimately exist only as approximations for the purposes of corporate marketing, I want to put in my two cents.<br /><br />So, here goes:<br /><br />1. Moral ambiguity does not determine whether something is YA or adult. Let me say that again: <i>Moral ambiguity does not determine whether something is YA or adult.</i> The main villain of <i>Dune</i> was essentially a moustache-twirling cardboard cutout. The main villain of <i>Lord of the Rings</i> wasn't even a stereotype, he was a basic archetype of evil with no other personality characteristics at all, who never even appears on-page. Yet neither of these get labelled as YA. Because, once again, moral ambiguity does not determine whether something is a mature story or not.<br /><br />2. If you have doubts about the claim above, consider that teenagers are in fact, in many cases, <i>more</i> likely than adults to be seduced by narratives about morally grey protagonists (see: my former obsession with the animes <i>Death Note</i> and <i>Code Geass</i> circa 2006 as evidence.) Why is this? Because such stories feel exciting and new to teenagers, who are, at least in the West, typically fed on a childhood diet of Disney films, <i>Star Wars</i> and other feel-good stories of good guys saving the day. Thus, by the time they reach adolescence, they have been primed to salivate over any book or movie that does the opposite of what a Disney film does, even if the way in which it does so is shallow, obvious, and not \"mature\" in any sense beyond the superficial \"morally grey\" label. This is why so many teenage boys (and stunted adult men) became obsessed with films like <i>The Dark Knight</i> and think that lines such as \"You either die a hero, or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain\" are the height of character depth not even to be matched by Shakespeare. <br /><br />3. If black and white, good and evil narratives do not define YA, then what does? <i>Hope</i>. This is the key ingredient that must be present in YA but not necessarily in adult. There must be some light at the end of the tunnel. This is why a film like <i>Parasite</i> would never work as YA, because the ending is devoid of hope or light. YA characters can be as dark as any other character in any genre, but the narrative itself must provide hope. <br /><br />Conclusion: To be clear, I'm not saying a morally grey story can't be deep or adult. But the moral ambiguity itself doesn't create depth. Depth creates depth. Yes, that may seem a silly thing to say but it is worth saying. Creating characters who feel human is a challenging endeavor. There are no shortcuts. To create a human character you must delve into everything that makes them who they are, you must explore their weaknesses and vulnerabilities, whether who they are is good or evil or somewhere in between. Simply creating a \"dark\" character will not cut it, at least not if you want your story to be remembered for more than a day. <br /><br /><b>ORIGINAL REVIEW:</b><br /><br />This has to be one of the best fantasy books I have ever read and certainly the best to come out since Fonda Lee's <i>Jade City</i>.<br /><br />When the blurb says this book is unapologetically feminist, it isn't kidding around. I am generally skeptical of anything that claims to be \"feminist SFF\" - too often this is code for a one-dimensional 'butt-kicking' female lead who somehow never bought into the values of her patriarchal society because she's just so ~*~cOoL~*~ and <i>Not Like Other Girls</i>. Cue my gigantic yawn. But this book, oh, this book - this is something else. <br /><br />See, the problem with all these well-meaning (or sometimes, let's be real, simply cash-grabbing) \"strong\" female lead books is that they basically completely leave out the stories of actual living, breathing women. You know, all the women who actually existed historically (and currently) who didn't have the luxury of being fictional characters in escapist fantasy books and thus couldn't simply cut off their hair, pick up a sword, run off on an adventure, and along the way discover they were some kind of magical chosen one and save the world. In real life, women weren't stupid. They knew they were living in a society that was stacked against them and so they had to get creative. They had to become skilled at the roles they were expected to inhabit because sometimes <i>that was the only way to survive</i>. And you can't gain power if you don't first survive. <br /><br />So here in <i>The Jasmine Throne</i> we have an absolutely brilliant story that showcases all the myriad of ways in which women survive long enough to gather power in a society like this. There is our heroine, Priya, who works as a maid for years and keeps her head down until the time is right. There is her sister, Bhumika, who marries for politics and plays the dutiful wife and generous matron for years until the time is right. There is the princess Malini who uses her tears as a weapon, spends time in prison because she is told to, manipulates everyone around her, but never learns to physically fight - yet you could not read this book and ever doubt that she is strong. <br /><br />Then there are the male characters, whose portrayal is in some ways where this book shines even brighter, because they are nuanced and human and yet they are still very, very much shown to be products of a society that teaches them to feel entitled to treat women as objects, or at best, as subordinates. Ashok, the misguided rebel leader, feels compassion for his female (and younger male) followers when they get hurt or killed but at the same time he views their deaths as inevitable, something for the greater good - he views winning as more important than anything else, even human lives. There is the the regent, Bhumika's husband, who is a practical and intelligent person and a capable leader in some ways but fails to ever come to see his brilliant and ambitious young wife as anything more than a baby-furnace. Even Malini's brother, the 'good' prince, is shown to be venerated more than he deserves simply because of his gender and his birth; he's a nice guy, but that's about it. And of course there is the villain, who burns women - actually, his was the one character that I would not categorize as nuanced, but then we barely see him and his character is clearly being set up for sequels. And, I mean, there are lots of men like him in real life, even today. Just watch recent news coming out of Afghanistan. SO. <br /><br />Even if feminism isn't your thing, this book has plenty to offer in terms of well-written characters and a setting that feels very unique and alive. I will definitely be checking out any future works by this author and putting the sequel on my to-read."

      "review": "<i>ARC received from the publisher (Orbit) in exchange for an honest review.</i><br /><br />I should not have put this off as long as I did - my fears about this book being a slow read because it was epic fantasy were baseless. Not only does it largely live up to the hype, it reads really really fast as well. And the romance subplot is exquisite - sapphic, morally gray, with with a strong hurt/comfort element.<blockquote>\n  <i>I know there is no higher power that sanctions a king or an emperor. There is only the moment when power is placed in your hands, and there is one truth: either you take the power and wield it, or someone else will. And perhaps they will not be as kind to you and yours.</i>\n</blockquote>Malini has been imprisoned in the Hirana - an ancient, decaying temple - for disobeying her emperor brother and refusing to be executed by burning. And if this is not enough, she is also sick from slowly being poisoned by the servant who was sent there with her. Priya is one of the maidservants cleaning her rooms and, secretly, a former temple child. Each has her own reason to hate the empire.<br /><br />What I loved the most about the book were the characters and their complexity. Priya and Malini's POV chapters are mixed with the occasional chapter from the POV of someone else, and everyone has their own goals and their own preferred means to achieve them, most of them quite ruthless. I liked that. It also affects the romance. Priya distrusts Malini, given her manipulative tendencies and being the princess of the very empire that colonised Ahiranya, which causes much tension between them, but both of them are drawn to each other. I loved the slowly developing romance - a character taking care of their sick love interest is my absolute favourite thing ever (<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3309937854\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">\n  <i>cough</i>\n</a>) and there is plenty of that here.<br /><br />The same approach also shows in the worldbuilding. There are several factions that hate the empire and are forced to cooperate because of that, but have little in common aside from that, ranging from only wanting the emperor replaced with another but not caring about Ahiranya, subtle rebellion, or liberation at all costs, no matter how much blood and lives it takes. It has a lot to say about power and how it changes people. In addition to political tensions, there is also the threat of a magical incurable plague, that manifests itself as plants growing under the skin.<br /><br />If intrigue, f/f romance with lots of hurt/comfort, epic fantasy with an Indian-inspired setting, or plant-based magic sound good to you, you should absolutely go for it. I am very curious to see where this series will go next.<br /><br /><b>Enjoyment:</b> 4/5<br /><b>Execution:</b> 4/5<br /><br /><b>Recommended to:</b> fans of the hurt/comfort trope, those looking for anti-colonialist fantasy or sapphic books, those looking for epic fantasy that's character-focused and not set in faux-medieval Europe, if you want moral grayness without grimdarkness<br /><b>Not recommended to:</b> uhh...can't think of any obvious drawbacks...<br /><br /><b>Content warnings:</b> epidemic (but fantastic enough that it was not at all an issue for me), some mild body horror involving plants<br /><br /><i>More reviews on my blog, <a href=\"https://otherworldsreviews.wordpress.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">To Other Worlds</a>.</i>"

      "review": "i dearly wish the author had put as much thought into whether the story of this book was for him to tell as he did into researching the subject of this book.<br /><br />as an account of economic subjugation and the corrosive spread of imperialism, the book is hardly inaccurate in its technicalities, but it never quite stops feeling like a thin veneer of fiction slapped onto the sociology thesis of a white man who discovered how racism works in college and found it \"fascinating\". <br /><br />baru's intentions and motives are an afterthought, blandly stated and stripped of feeling. her experiences feel academic rather than visceral. her detachment regarding certain circumstances defies sense; she is almost bizarrely oblivious to things that directly impact her as a woman, as a lesbian, as an indigenous person. her experiences, her identity feel poorly incorporated into her personality, only tacked on as an afterthought to justify some of her more heinous actions. she feels, in essence, like the standard white male fantasy protagonist with brown paint and a wig on, who suddenly remembers she's meant to be playing an indigenous lesbian and throws in a line about how she likes women and misses her homeland. it doesn't help that the writing style, while technically excellent and cutting, is dry and disengaged.<br /><br />to be clear, none of the things she does or the ways she acts are necessarily unrealistic on their own. watching a character learn to bury their emotions in a unforgiving system, make pragmatic allegiances, internalize a distaste for their identities and make terrible sacrifices for what they perceive to be a greater good ... they can make for fascinating character trajectories - but that <i>trajectory</i> simply does not exist here. <br /><br />baru is empty of interiority from the beginning: <input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"spoiler__control\" aria-label=\"The following text has been marked spoiler.

(why are they called sodomites in a world with no christianity?) perhaps they exist to reinforce this idea to baru, but again, why she internalizes homophobia in the first place is a mystery. <input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"spoiler__control\" aria-label=\"The following text has been marked spoiler.

      "review": "**I tried to use spoiler tags but I'm on mobile and they may not have worked.**<br /><br />There were aspects of this book I thought were done quite well, but there was a lot that didn't really work for me. I'm of a mixed mind about reading the subsequent books -- I want a payoff for what this book puts its characters through, but I don't get the sense that that payoff is coming.<br /><br />What I thought was done well:<br />- The portrayal of an insidious empire that conquers new lands through economic policy and forced cultural assimilation was well executed. The forced cultural assimilation was almost TOO well executed; I think it would be upsetting for anyone whose culture has been devastated in this way. Reading these parts of it, about cultural genocide, is not remotely enjoyable; it's gut-wrenching. I think that means it's effective, but I'm not sure I wanted to have my gut wrenched that hard. I also would advise everyone going in to understand that's the kind of story that it is.<br /><br />- The relationships between characters, when we got to see them. This is not a character-driven story, but when we spend time with the characters, all of them have distinct personalities and interesting aspects to them (albeit with some issues for Baru, but I'll get to that). Tain Hu was definitely well written, and there are some quite funny quips and some insightful conversations. I also really liked Nayauru and wish she had gotten a bit more time being present (more page-time? what do we say for books?).<br /><br />- The varied cultures outside the Masquerade empire. This could be a bit hit or miss, or hard to keep track of since there were a lot, but I did like that there were these specific traditions for specific cultures that came up here and again.<br /><br />-The evolution of Baru. <input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"spoiler__control\" aria-label=\"The following text has been marked spoiler. Toggle checkbox to reveal or hide.\" onchange=\"this.labels[0].setAttribute('aria-hidden', !this.checked);\" id=\"94340316-22f5-44bb-a47a-650c1c14d8ef\" /><label aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"spoiler\" for=\"94340316-22f5-44bb-a47a-650c1c14d8ef\">She starts as this curious and observant child, makes mistakes along the way, suffers from grief and horror at what she is doing, but ultimately lets herself (or forces herself) to become a monster in her own eyes. It was well done.</label><br /><br />-The depiction of being a closeted lesbian in a repressive society. I thought the turmoil and sense of an unspeakable <i>something</i> was done surprisingly well for a book written by a man. It got a bit over-wrought at times, but especially early on, when Baru is a child, it felt very natural, and the way she admires women and women's bodies felt genuine.<br /><br />What didn't work for me:<br />- The pacing. I don't know how to describe it other than bizarre. This novel covers Baru Cormorant's life from age 7 to age 22 or 23 or so. I did like the section spent on her childhood, where we briefly got a chance to see what Baru-untouched-by-empire was like, but as the story goes on and more and more and more has to happen, I found myself wondering if we wouldn't have been served better with flashbacks for that period instead. Because we have to cover so much time, there are these really awkward time skips. <input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"spoiler__control\" aria-label=\"The following text has been marked spoiler. Toggle checkbox to reveal or hide.\" onchange=\"this.labels[0].setAttribute('aria-hidden', !this.checked);\" id=\"3ef4c7c1-7963-4fd9-aba1-f6f4fa1a2efa\" /><label aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"spoiler\" for=\"3ef4c7c1-7963-4fd9-aba1-f6f4fa1a2efa\">We go from a single day at the market, age seven, to a rapid blow-by-blow of her school years, slow down to have her meeting with Animata, and then we skip to graduation and spend a real-time look at her first days on Aurdwynn, only to follow this with a jump of three years, and then a blur of activity that's honestly a bit hard to keep track of time wise, and so on.</label> It read sort of like a bunch of vignettes tied together by very distant narrative. The vignettes were excellent to read, and the narrative wasn't bad when it didn't go on for too long, but from halfway through the book to very near the end, it's almost entirely distant narrative, and that was a slog to get through.<br /><br />- Still on the topic of pacing: specifically, the military campaign. <input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"spoiler__control\" aria-label=\"The following text has been marked spoiler. Toggle checkbox to reveal or hide.\" onchange=\"this.labels[0].setAttribute('aria-hidden', !this.checked);\" id=\"366bd3f7-ec2c-48ee-a704-e6c8565b899d\" /><label aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"spoiler\" for=\"366bd3f7-ec2c-48ee-a704-e6c8565b899d\">The entire campaign of the rebellion was, for me, really boring (except the final battle). It felt like someone giving me a blow-by-blow of their latest Age of Empires game, or a D&amp;D campaign, or something. \"These people moved here and did this and then these people went here and did this and then they countered with this\" for pages and pages was not interesting to me. It might appeal to people who enjoy reading military histories, though. I just am not into that kind of thing.</label><br /><br />- Baru and Tain Hu's relationship. <input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"spoiler__control\" aria-label=\"The following text has been marked spoiler. Toggle checkbox to reveal or hide.\" onchange=\"this.labels[0].setAttribute('aria-hidden', !this.checked);\" id=\"8a08eec8-b790-4edc-9d2b-6c3cb2e76bd1\" /><label aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"spoiler\" for=\"8a08eec8-b790-4edc-9d2b-6c3cb2e76bd1\">It's obvious from the start of the book that Baru is a lesbian, and it's clear from the chemistry these two have when they meet that there will be something more eventually. I understand that Baru is insanely sexually repressed because the empire has colonized her mind, but for the love of all that is holy, they didn't even HOLD HANDS until over 70% into the book, and they didn't actually become lovers until the very end... and it's only for one night and then Baru immediately betrays Tain Hu and has to kill her the next time they meet. Don't get me wrong: I want unwholesome lesbian representation! I want lesbians who are killers and traitors and warlords and what have you. That would be interesting and cool! But Baru seems to only be a lesbian to facilitate her suffering as a lesbian. There are scads and scads of stories about lesbians suffering because they are lesbians. It actually isn't all that revolutionary to make another such story with the same sort of sex-then-death ending for one half of the couple, even if you make it explicit in the narrative that you think homophobia is bad.</label><br /><br />- The Empire of Masks. Where did they come from? How did they get this powerful? How did they interact with the other nations before they were an empire? How long have they been so powerful? Why don't they have more active challengers/competing empires? Why is homosexuality the worst sin, and not, say, extramarital sex, when they seem so focused on controlling all births? Why are women allowed essentially completely equal places in this society that sees women as inherently hysterical and as essentially livestock to be bred? It's just not consistent within itself; I had trouble believing in it as an entity. <br /><br />- Related to the above: the mish-mash of technology. <input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"spoiler__control\" aria-label=\"The following text has been marked spoiler. Toggle checkbox to reveal or hide.\" onchange=\"this.labels[0].setAttribute('aria-hidden', !this.checked);\" id=\"361b07af-4564-41ee-83e5-ffe17b3c8ca9\" /><label aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"spoiler\" for=\"361b07af-4564-41ee-83e5-ffe17b3c8ca9\">People fight on horseback with swords... but the empire also has the technology to genetically engineer supersoldier slaves who have no ego and derive joy solely from serving others?</label> This could maybe work if we got a clearer sense of what the empire as a society is like (are they extra advanced, compared to the other socities?) but we don't.<br /><br />- Related to the above: <input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"spoiler__control\" aria-label=\"The following text has been marked spoiler. Toggle checkbox to reveal or hide.\" onchange=\"this.labels[0].setAttribute('aria-hidden', !this.checked);\" id=\"95115d25-de11-44f1-b683-495f640c75a6\" /><label aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"spoiler\" for=\"95115d25-de11-44f1-b683-495f640c75a6\">The Clarified. I know we're supposed to be disturbed and disgusted by them (or by extension, the empire that made them), and I was! But I was too grossed out by the idea of a human with no real sense of self, and the narrative didn't do nearly enough to show that they still <i>did</i> have a sense of self somewhere deep down. I also just don't believe you could make a human like that. Maybe we're meant to believe it's weird drug magic, or SOMETHING, but it seemed like grimdark creepiness for the sake of it.</label><br /><br />- The depiction of eugenics. Eugenics, historically, has been about one ethnic group believing in their own superiority and trying to stamp out (or rule over) others for that reason. The Masquerade is all about eugenics and breeding and \"hygiene,\" but they seem to be wanting to breed an ideal human. It felt... callous? ill-informed? To use the very real concept of eugenics in this very unreal way. I had trouble suspending my disbelief.<br /><br />- Baru was so withdrawn and closed off that she sometimes failed to have a consistent personality. <br /><br />My petty grievances:<br />- Calling someone a sodomite implies the existence of the Bible/the story of Sodom and Gomorrah. Surely a different word could have been used. Alternately, if they have the word sodomite, they might as well also have the word lesbian or sapphic, since these words also have etymology strictly tied to our real world. (Of course, these words aren't offensive like sodomite.) <br /><br />- Translation is for documents. Interpreting is for speech. I know this is INCREDIBLY petty, but I am a translator, and I wouldn't be able to interpret well for someone, and the way these words are used interchangeably is a big pet peeve.<br /><br />-There's a line in the book that's just an explanatory narrative line for drama, something like, \"Where wolves were hunted by civilization, coyotes survived.\" It's to explain why a coyote is a cool symbol. However, wolves being hunted by humans and coyotes surviving isn't something that seems at all tied to the world of this novel (in fact, we don't hear about local coyotes at all) so it just stuck out in a weird way.<br /><br />TL;DR: There's a lot here of interest and a lot here that annoyed me, ultimately because there is just a lot going on. I'm curious to see how the later stories might develop their focus but hesitant to commit to what might be a very miserable story."

      "review": "Finally, finally I have <i>finished</i> this one. This little jerk of a book has left my library account with an overdue for like over half a year now. (Thank god they have removed late fees). I had the hardest time getting into it. The shackles will finally be removed from my Libby account, such sweet, sweet freedom! Now I will write this review cause I have thoughts, but I’m going to write it on my phone in all my dyslexic glory cause that’s my level of disdain. If words are missing or the paragraphs breaks make you sad, I’m sorry. <br /><br />Ok so I’m being unfair and blaming my stubborn reading rut on Baru, and it’s <i>fine</i> maybe even <i>good.</i> But I’d like to think I’m justified somehow in my attention slipping off. When a book keeps me thinking “Gee, I feel like a TV adaptation would be much better for this story.” or “I’m getting nostalgic for the way George RR Martin writes political fantasy.” you know things are dire.<br /><br />So here’s my highly sophisticated breakdown. <br /><br /><b>\n  <u>Good Stuff</u>\n</b><br /><br /><u>Systems of Oppression </u><br />In regards to colonialism, gender, and race, but especially in regard to queerness. I felt so sad for Baru having to continually deny her own happiness in order to survive and rise to power. Just her longing alone made her fragile to her enemies at every corner to the point where she needs to constantly self police her own identity. Having to pretend to be straight or keep it an option on the table politically. Even chasteness is suspicious and criticized, there’s no way to hide from scrutiny. It’s a high political fantasy drama, but it feels very truthful to the everyday queer experience in our current world. <br /><br /><u>Finance and Economic Power Plays</u><br />You don’t often get stories of conquest that include manipulating the monetary policy of a nation or managing the accounting of a rebellion. So although I glazed through parts of it, It was very interesting and gave our finance-educated outsider main character a unique edge and a reason for all these warring factions to keep her around. Fantasy economics! Whoo! <br /><br /><u>The Ending</u><br />It was good! Much stronger than like 80% of the book. The author wrote it first before the rest of the story and it shows. I was determined to give this book only two stars but I had to give the goddamn ending its due. If only the plot could have been more interesting as it was developing.<br /><br />Which leads us to..<br /><br /><b>\n  <u>Not Good Stuff</u>\n</b><br />no one likes a whiner but I do like to whine. <br /><br /><u>Genius ‘Savant’ Main Character</u> <br />This was the most contrived anime, Death Note-esque’ part of the book. Our main character at the old wizened age of 17, somehow is the master of bureaucracy despite her previous experience being ‘school’. Like can you at least give the girl an internship first? Does she even know how an office looks like before getting the job of “Tax Minister for an Entire Nation.” Don’t worry guys, she read the state’s How-To-Conquer-Stuff manual first, she’s got this.<br /><br />I know that our culture is super obsessed with youth so I’m used to mentally tacking on 5 years to YA protagonists anyway, but Baru being a ‘savant genius’ is like <i>so</i> important to the plot it just comes across as eye rolling. Guys, remember how cringe Sherlock got? This had the same stank. <br /><br />And I guess it wouldn’t have gotten to me so badly if literally the entire plot and endgame didn’t hinge on it. Seriously, it was the entire plot of the book was about being recognized as the specialest person, the coolest operator in the castle. To the point where every other character can martyr themselves in order to help our hero get promoted. It comes across as very simple and shallow and I hate it. Call it a pet peeve. Genius is never as rare as fiction makes it out to be, and it’s not the only quality that gives advantage in success. Especially in rebellion, where networks are often time more important than individuals. But this book takes the opposite stance. <br /><br />II’ll give anime a pass for doing this shit but I wont give it here! Fie!! <br /><br /><u>Boring Cast of Side Characters</u><br />This book had a ton of characters but no appendix which should be a crime punishable by death in publishing. It felt like there were only 3 personalities across most of the cast. The manner of speaking was nearly identical across all characters despite there being tons of different cultures and class backgrounds. Kind of hard to keep track of intrigue plots if every person feels the same. Tain Hu was the glowing exception. You know what? Fuck Baru, this book would have ruled from Tain Hu’s POV. <br /><br /><br /><u>Boring Setting</u><br />Audwynn was.. flat. I was imagining like a vast Russia like country. But we got barely any description of the different landscapes or towns. Nothing memorable. This is a story about tactics and vassals and moving between countries but it’s hard to keep track of any of that shit if you don’t describe it. I hate to show the GRRM card, but we knew what the fuck Kings Landing, the Riverlands, The Vale, Winterfell all looked and felt like. The world felt interesting and the changing of the lands felt important! <br /><br />I don’t care about your intrigue plot if your characters and settings are all cardboard.<br /><br /><u>Telling, not Showing</u><br />I don’t think the Show, Not Tell rule really applies in most written fiction but it really would have helped here. There was so much plot that we didn’t get to see, the rising of the peasantry, marching in an army, sailing on boats. Almost all of it was just summed up like an email. There’s a reason why the most engrossing parts of the book are the duel and the ending, where the reader is allowed to be part of the events of the story. <br /><br /><br /><b>\n  <u>In Conclusion</u>\n</b><br />Sorry, for being unfair. I recognize that I am being unjust to a book that I kept putting down for outside reasons, but we are done with each other! I can nod across room at it when we finished our class together and tune out when people tell me what whats it’s up to after graduation. Good luck with all your future conquestin’, Baru! I hope you find a nice girl to settle down with."

      "review": "Initial reaction upon finishing: holy fucking shit fuck. I am reeling and breathless with shock. This book is beautifully brutal, jarring, and cruel. I'm really struggling for words to describe how it left me.<br /><br />Baru is a lesbian of colour from Taranoke, where sexuality is fluid and polyamory is seen as the norm for families, and when the Masquerade comes with cultural imperialism and kills one of her fathers, Baru swears vengeance. She will work through the system until she is powerful enough to tear it down. This is a concept I love, especially as someone who personally experiences oppression. There is always a conflict regarding whether to work within the system or to destroy it, which would have more potential, and which would actually culminate true liberation and justice. This is what Baru faces, and the book chronicles her working through both of these paths. We don't ever get to actually see Baru achieve her vengeance or the end results of her culminating actions. Rather, this is a book about the extremes, sacrifices, and betrayals one may face or make while working toward such a goal. While the book does have a heavy plot, I would almost dare to say that the focus of the book isn't on the actual events, but on Baru's development as a character and the realization of her purpose and what she must do. It’s a heavy read. It deals with colonisation, eugenics, institutional homophobia, genocide.<br /><br />Baru's identity as a lesbian is one of the key aspects of the book, but mostly through her repression of her love for women. There is a significant romance, but it is very subtle and slow, and in the end, that relationship is sacrificed for Baru's greater goal. The ending simultaneously chilled my heart and filled it with awe. Originally I was going to rate the book 3.5 stars because the middle dragged for me, but it built up to make that ending all the more intense. I was totally shocked--it's the type of thing where it seems like it comes out of nowhere, but when you think back, there were so many hints and so much foreshadowing. <br /><br />Not necessarily the most captivating read, by which I mean that I could put it down without itching to pick it up again, but I think this is a book best enjoyed slowly, taking breaks and coming back to it again and again."

      "review": "My feelings on this book sort of ran the gamut, but it finished strong.<br /><br />In the beginning this story offered a lot of things I liked - there was the world building, the representation, and I do enjoy some good political/court intrigue. The main character is a queer woman, a savant and accountant who hopes to rise through the ranks of the Imperial Republic in order to get herself into position to change the Empire’s ways and free her homeland from its clutches. The Empire offers education, sanitation, and security, but at the cost of cultural erasure, eugenics, and the imposition of its own values and machinations. Those in charge of the Empire test Baru’s worthiness by setting her the task of taking into hand Aurdwynn, a colony known for rebellion and its historical refusal to be ruled.<br /><br />Things started out very promising, but after about the first third or so, I got SOOOO BOOOOOORED. The FF romance was pretty epic in some ways, but I could never muster much of any feeling for most of the characters, so the relationships wound up feeling pretty dry to me overall.<br /><br />However, at the very end things got REALLY GOOD again. That bumped my final rating back up to 4 stars. Now I’m torn about reading the sequel - so much promise, but will I be bored to tears once again in order to reach the “good stuff”?"

      "review": "<b>“She had always loved the stars. But in the desert of winter it was impossible to forget that they were cold, and distant, and did not care.”</b><br /><br />5/5 stars. This review contains spoilers. A spoiler warning has been given before this. If you haven´t read this, I urge you not to read this review. Only know that this book is perfect in every way, shape and form. <br /><br /><b>Trigger warnings:</b> murder, colonialism, homophobia, sexism, off page rape, torture, talk of genital mutilation, death, gore, forced reproduction, war. <br /><br /><b>The Traitor Baru Cormorant</b> is one of those books that leaves a bittersweet taste after finishing. It is also, I would argue, one of the books that are either a hit or miss, either succesful or terrible in execution. <b>Baru Cormorant</b> for me, is a big big <i>success.</i> It is and <i>will always be</i> a book I love and hate at the same time. I´ve read this book <b>twice</b> and twice I´ve been surprised by its <i>brutality.</i> <b>Twice</b> I´ve had the pleasure to say that it is my favourite. It is absolutely everything I´ve been searching for in a fantasy book: a cunning, rutheless, intelligent protagonist and a world just as horrible to match it. <br /><br /> <b> <s>The Masquerade</s></b><br /><br /><i>\"The Empire of Masks, dear, or the Imperial Republic. Its rude to abbreviate.\"</i><br /><br /> <b> <s>The Masquerade</s></b> doesn´t conquer through war, but through necessities: oils, skins, ceramics, dyes, and most importantly: <i>indoctrination.</i> Children are separated from their families and taken to \"Charity Schools\". Their parents either prosecuted or killed by the Masquerade. They are taught the <i>\"names of sin\",</i> and the avoidance of them (with horrifying consequences if not avoided). Aside from <i>indoctrination</i> methods we have: Incrastic thought and eugenics. I´m disgusted, but its smart. <br /><br />Amongst the mess we have Baru: <b>\n  <i> \"Baru Cormorant, because a cormorant was the only thing that made me stop crying.\"</i>\n</b> <br /><br />Baru is taken to the Schools after the return of only one of her fathers. She is smart and turns out to be a <i> savant </i>in economics. (and sincerely my deepest admiration because economics make no sense to me) As a loyalty test, she is sent off to <b>Aurdwynn</b>, a place which has been a problem to the Masquerade for years: A land divided by dukes, no way to make trade work, fighters coming in from the North and valuable resources that are impossible to take in the current state the country is in. <br /><br /><b>“Freedom granted by your rulers is just a chain with a little slack.” </b><br /><br />By simple rule, <b>Aurdwynn</b> is divided into <b>three simple powers: </b> The Jurispotence, The Governor and The Imperial Accountant. Baru is offered the later. She must repair the mess left by the previous accountants, control trade, tax, and loans. However, the ledgers are a mess and she knows that the Accountant is, in simple terms, <b>the key to a rebellion success.</b><br /><br />Her job, is exactly that: bringing order to the country, making it governable for the Empire. She sets of to find webs of money and sedition, only to find dead ends in the ledgers and documents provided by the bank. In Tain Hu´s ledgers though, Baru finds exactly what she hopes: money laundering and the plans to buy out debts. <br /><br /><b>“I used to wonder if you were a monster. Now I know the answer. If you want power in this world, power enough to change it, it seems you have to be.” </b><br /><br />Evidently, economic policy is a big big theme throughout the book. All the fantasy I´ve read until now focuses on rebellions, but mainly through <i>brute force</i> and <i>idealism.</i> (and a happily ever after) While yes, I agree rebellions definitely need a spark, its not the only thing that makes them stand. Soldiers, cavalry, weapons and food must be bought. The way in which economy is <i>used</i> in the book provides a whole new point of view and gives such a great power to Baru that its just <b>*chef´s kiss*</b> It brings into light so many questions, maybe generalized in <b> does the end justify the means? If I am to fight these people, how much of myself am I willing to sacrifice for it? And others?</b><br /><br />Aside from the economic and rebellion dynamics, gender, colonization and homosexuality are explored. <b>The Masquerade</b> is an empire that thrives on divisions. From dividing harborside and plainside in Taranoke by Treaties and trade, to dividing the sexes and creating certain gender impositions and sterotypes that play such a big role on how Baru is expected to act.<br /><br /><b>\n  <i>Listen to me, Baru. Young women express numerous hysterias and neuroses. It is a scientific fact...</i>\n</b><br /><br />You know those books where women are granted power solely by their partners? Well if you are tired of that, look no more. Baru Cormorant gets power on her own. <b>Meritocracy</b> is one of the fundamental pillars of the Empire too, and while one could argue meritocracy is faulty at best (mainly because its well known that we are not all born with the same opportunities) The Empire of Masks is convinced otherwise. Either way, Baru <i>does question this</i> multiple times. <br /><br /><b>\n  <i>\"...You are young. The hereditary strengths of your people...<br />\"And here i thought only wit mattered behind the Mask\" </i>\n</b><br /><br /><b>Baru</b> as a character is wow. Just wow. She is dark, manipulative, methodical, clever, selfish. Her internal dialogue is chilling. One can´t help but wonder, is it for survival? Or is it something else? The thing is, even young, Baru´s stream of consciousness is *shudders*: Doubting whether she should help her cousin at school or lose the patronage Farrier gave her, feeding the Empire people and informants, killing off entires Dukes after they prove unmovable, betraying Tain Hu and watching (unflinching and unmoved) her death. *screams in panic* Honestly, I have not yet decided if its survival or just plain ruthlessness, but I have a bad feeling anyhow and the book titles are huge spoilers anyway. <br /><br />Even after this, even after reading her thoughts and seeing her actions you can´t help but feel some kind of sympathy to her. I <b>hated</b> Bel Latheman. The banker didn´t do anything wrong per se (besides serving the fucking Empire) but the way Baru thinks of him makes you feel the same as her, as does the situation with <b>Duke Lyxaxu</b>. I felt <i>betrayed</i> and it wasn´t even that Lyxaxu was on the Empire´s side (but I forgot that in the moment *ahem*) he just knew what was going to happen afterwards, and was killed because of it. <br /><br />The Dukes and their banter can make my whole day, thank you. But, this book did me so dirty. SO SO SO SO DIRTY. I loved <b>Unuxekome</b> and <b>Vutjag</b> and I just can´t think about it, sorry.<b>Nayauru</b> (while she lasted) was incredible to read about and like Lyxaxu, she paid the price for outplaying Baru (not that she was good anyways, but I don´t think anyone in this book is particularly nice)<br /><br /><b>“That old sick joy, her first and favorite drug. Control.”</b><br /><br />There isn´t much romance in this book. Which I cherish, but the small happy moment we got is so meaningful to the rest of the book and possibly (when I binge the other books) the whole trilogy. Baru has been living and repressing herself in fear for years (even amidst the rebellion) that when she finally chooses not to deny it *cries* There is no coherent thought. <br /><br />Personally too, I think the plot did a good job at mixing politics, economics, war and the teensy tiny bit of romance there is. It´s rather stressful at the start (second time around actually made more sense to me) but it starts slowing down towards the rebellion part in which of course, the usage of money (specifically gold, not paper money) is explored but not so much as in the avoidance of imminent rebellion.<br /><br />I´m off to binge the next one. 100% recommended. THIS BOOK IS BEING SLEPT ON AND ITS SO GOOD. <br /><br /><b>“Good-bye, she thinks. Good-bye, kuye lam. I will write your name in the ruin of them. I will paint you across history in the color of their blood.” </b>"

      "review": "This book is fucking brutal. It brings common fantasy tropes to the 21th century; there is a big Empire that employs eugeneticists and modern medicine to subdue the populace of the countries that are conquered. Something about plagues and inoculation, something about the use of religion to enforce a strict gender boundary. The Empire is kind of what European colonists must have been like. <br />And then there is our protagonist, someone who is willing to sacrifice a lot in order to save her own people. <br />It is not a happy book. But despite all the betrayals there is this central question - how much would you be willing to do to pursue a goal that is bigger than just your own success? A very relevant question in this weird year with its own quarantine and plague. This book is for Bakker fans who want a woke version. <br />And the queer representation! Again, this is far from a happy book and the empire is extremely homophobic and transphobic. Somehow it is a bit better to stomach because it isn't shown as the status quo but as violence (both metaphorical and literal) enacted by the state. But it is still cool to read an aside about nonbinary people being very common (but they have to pass to survive in the empire) and nontraditional family structures with multiple fathers/mothers were the norm until the empire came along."

But the plot twist is not my problem. It's the 300 pages before that try and fail to get me invested into a rebellion written both too shallow and too detailed and which is ultimately doomed to tumble and serve as Baru's stepping stone to her next job level. It's supposed to be a punch in the gut, I understand that as well the reasoning why the second rebellion has to happen. But in the end, I felt like I wasted my time reading about it. The emotional cost is there either way, through Tain Hu's presence. But if it was just about Baru using Aurdwynn and fucking it over, it could've been done in the first third. <i>Everything</i> the book tries to say is already covered in the first third.<br /><br />Also I'm not sure if the book should be recommended for sapphic rep since all you get is some vague yearning between the lines, one page of one character waking up after a night together and the rest being a lot of queer pain and homophobia.</label>"

It was recommended to me by other lesbians as being good representation and relatable, and I guess it is, in a depressing way. But I’m also like “Why do you like this book???” We’ve got the overwhelming homophobia I of the society (tribades punished with fgm), internalized homophobia, and repression. The tension and the love interest is obvious and even enjoyable in parts, but it doesn’t make up for the ultimate betrayal of trust in this author.<br /><br />Tragic. Don’t read. The Author clearly thinks he’s doing something significant and literary, but it's just another dead lesbian story."

      "review": "I DNFed the ebook at 10% then got the audiobook and am DNFing it at 30%. This is just not the book for me; the narration is incredibly distant from the characters which makes me not care about them at all. The most compelling part is the beginning with Baru’s family, but even then she is unlikeable, I just liked her parents. I think the author might have been unknowingly going for an autistic character (but based on the male stereotype), and the execution is unpleasant. Baru is kind of an analytical drone who wants a head pat for being so clever all the time, but actually feels nothing for anyone and sees people as pawns for her to exploit. <br /><br />The homophobia in this book is at the forefront throughout all that I listened to, and the author named lesbian and gay people really oddly, as the use of the word sodomite implies the existence of the Old Testament in this world. I also understand that tribadist was used in the 17th-19th century to refer to lesbians, but this is high fantasy and that history does not exist. I don’t feel like a queer person wrote this book, and that makes the whole thing sit wrong with me. <br /><br />If you like plots driven accounting and talking about all the drama of an empire using only its money, you might like this. Clearly many people did. I understand there is an interesting reveal at the end, but I honestly cannot imagine slogging through more hours of this dry book to get to it."

      "review": "This is the best lesbian accountant imperialist hard-fantasy novel I've ever read.<br /><br />Wait, I've already used that joke in a review this year, um, okay, let's try again.<br /><br />Some passing points:<br />- Baru is an *absolutely terrifying* protagonist, and I can't really say that I blame her, considering how this book starts. Just be warned that this is not a happy book, and Baru is not a happy character: by the end of the book, she's running so many levels of gambits that it's almost impenetrable.<br />- I have never read a book that has made me want to read more about the minutiae of accounting, but somehow this one pulls it off? Several pages are spent on schemes of \"and this is exactly how I'll pull off my financial scheme!\", which sounds excruciating but is actually really engaging reading.<br />- The entire book is effortlessly queer, in a way that I love (being a gigantic queer mess of a person myself), because it just comes across as a lived-in world: Baru has two dads and a mom, passing mention is made to a culture in which all marriages are polyamorous, one culture has a third gender, complete with discussions of how members of said gender fit into other cultures that don't understand, and of course there's the Evil Heteronormative Empire.<br />- Having said that, the body count in this book is INCREDIBLY high, so your favorite character is probably screwed, whoever it is. I suppose that's what I should have expected, considering the title and genre, but this definitely leans hard into the Game of Thrones level of violence at times.<br />- I hate and love the ending, and won't say any more than that. It's even basically the ending that I expected and I'm still just over here going aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.<br />- aaaaaaaaa okay, done flailing"

      "review": "Received to review via Netgalley and a won proof copy<br /><br />I first heard of this via Kameron Hurley’s enthusiastic response on Twitter, and requested it pretty much based on that. It was only later that I read critical reviews/thoughts, like Foz Meadows’ and Liz Bourke’s, and while it made me feel a little more wary, I decided I was going to give it a go anyway. And I did, and to me, that central thesis that this is a book with a message, “Homophobia Is Bad”, which brings the message across by all queer people being unhappy… isn’t true. Nobody here “suffer[s] unbearably because of their orientation”, but because of the imperialist, colonial reaction to their sexual orientation.<br /><br />It’s not a Queer Tragedy story where the main character is gay and struggling. She’s not struggling because she’s gay. She’s struggling because the Empire of Masks believes that the customs of her homeland are wrong, she disagrees, and she is determined to fight it at whatever cost. Everything that happens to her is her choice. It would be more of a Queer Tragedy if she was eventually manoeuvred into the position she’s in at the end of the novel, if it wasn’t her choice. But it is. And I don’t think this is saying there’s no hope for Baru, either; yes, she has done some terrible things, betrayed every cause except the one closest to her heart. But she’s holding onto that. She’s not broken. She does not accept a gilded cage.<br /><br />As for “the evil empire is too evil” criticisms… well. The British Empire used all these methods to assimilate colonies. Maybe not at the same time, in the same place, but they did. The issue is not whether those things are going on, but control of the information: these things do look very bad to us now, partly because we see them in our past and know the harm they caused, partly because we get a privileged view. If the Masquerade don’t publicise those things are happening, people might know that some of it is going on. They can write it off to bad management, to unfair application of policies, to a particular person being corrupted — rather than seeing it as a whole, a pattern, that defines the empire. That’s pretty clearly shown to be in effect here, as far as I can see. We see the Empire for what it is, and so does Baru with her carefully split and guarded identity, but just because we as readers can doesn’t mean we would’ve in real life when these things occurred.<br /><br />And, a thought that I suspect is very uncomfortable for a lot of people, we don’t now. You can ignore an awful lot of shit when you’re not the one who directly faces it.<br /><br />Anyway. Going back to just the story — I loved it. It’s a painful, wrenching story, and yes, it goes through the dark side of capitalism and colonialism a lot. It explores what one person has to do, has to change, to try and make a difference, and the pain it brings them. It’s really well written: this is a story with an accountant at the centre, as the hero, and yet her machinations are still as fascinating as any duel. It also deals with people being people: complex, split in their loyalties, unpredictable. Driven by emotion. I believed in every character here, and that they thought they were the hero of their own story.<br /><br />I recommend it. Sending the proof copy to my sister ASAP, though I suspect she may kill me when she reads the end.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://breathesbooks.com/2015/10/10/review-the-traitor-baru-cormorant/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Originally posted here.</a>"

      "review": "There's a common idea in table top role playing games that if your players are invested or attached to a specific non-player character or companion, then you should kill off that being in order to evoke emotions in your players. The issue with this is that if you do this too often, then the players will no longer invest themselves in your story or grow to actively dislike it. It's quite easy to see the parallel in fiction writing and it's the same mistake that this story makes for me.<br /><br />For me, this book has the wrappings for things that I would enjoy. A native, skilled female protagonist that seeks to free her homeland from the colonists who have invaded and destroyed her home. It takes place in a medieval-esque world filled with a great many cultures of interest and follows a queer romance. <br /><br />However, things quickly go awry as the main character feels wooden, mechanical, and not really human for a large portion of the book (after the first few chapters, but before the last half). Although this may largely be intentional, it's hard for me to be in the head of someone like this. Additionally, many of the things I enjoyed about the world and story were thrown away towards the end. Every bit of character that I enjoyed was absolutely trashed by the plot leaving little in its wake save for the protagonist.<br /><br />Despite this, the story is well written. The prose in the story is excellent and I would be remiss if I didn't mention that this is one of the few stories that actually gave me chills from reading a fight scene. I place a premium on stories that evoke emotions and reactions from me and this one takes the cake. Unfortunately, most of it is hate.<br /><br />I want to avoid spoilers, but if you're going to give me colonizers in a story that enact eugenics, hate crimes, and cultural genocide, then you cannot let them win. I cannot abide by having someone support them. Truly, someone who promised to be a liberator and ends up being a scab are among my most despised individuals and at the end of this story they are all that's left. This narrative was a sieve that separated and threw out everything I enjoyed or rooted for. I won't be continuing this series. It managed to evoke emotions within me, but it was mostly disgust or anger. "

      "review": "<i>The Traitor Baru Cormorant</i> is a kick to the guts, in all the best ways.<br /><br />The book is about Baru Cormorant, a young woman whose small nation is undergoing colonisation by the Masked Empire. The Masked Empire brings medicine, roads, wealth, but follows strict laws of eugenics: it recognises families consisting only of one father and one mother, and arranges breeding of humans to bring out the best “racial” characteristics. As a child, Baru is sent from her mother and two fathers to one of the Empire’s new schools, where she displays prodigious talent in economics and mathematics. She hatches a plan to rise through the Empire’s ranks and free her people from within. But first she must overcome the Empire’s test: to bring order as Imperial Accountant in another of its colonised countries. There, the dukes are planning their own rebellions, her every move is reported back to the Empire, and trust seems impossible.<br /><br />Reading <i>The Traitor</i> is like running a marathon. I don’t think I’ve ever been so tense reading a book before, and definitely not for such an overwhelming chunk of it. As soon as Baru steps into the role of Imperial Accountant, she becomes surrounded by people who she absolutely can’t trust, and who absolutely can’t trust her, and yet it’s impossible to get anywhere without at least pretending to do so. A lot of the book involves her and the other important players testing each other’s loyalty and trying to trap each other into revealing incriminating information. The thing is, even if the person passes the loyalty tests, Baru can’t really be sure if it’s true or if they’re trying to lull her into a false sense of security… Consequently, tension and stakes are raised by Chapter 3, and remain consistently high till the last few chapters, where they somehow manage to crescendo.<br /><br />The plots upon plots are thus complicated, but never overwhelmingly so. This is helped by the well-defined major side characters. Although their goals can be unclear, their personalities remain relatively stable and broadly painted: the cold and calculating Xate Yawa, the boisterous and slightly naive Duke Unuxekome, the loyal, wolfish, and passionate Duchess Vultjag. In stark contrast, I wasn’t sure if I understood Baru correctly until near the very end of the book. She’s a fantastic character: very cold, pragmatic, capable of hard choices, yet at the same time undeniably driven primarily by passion and love.  Baru’s not necessarily likable – some of her choices might be unforgivable to readers – but she’s certainly sympathetic and fascinating to follow.<br /><br />In terms of themes, I found the exploration of colonialism and the “correct” ways to tear down power structures thought-provoking. Baru’s choice of working with the Empire to take power for herself and her people is constantly second-guessed, both by herself and the people around her. How much of herself does she lose every time she follows the Empire’s commands? But is it even possible to defeat them without working within their confines? The matter is further complicated by the fact that the Empire is not wholly evil – only because of its laws is Baru, a commoner, able to disregard bloodlines and rise in power based on her intelligence alone. Yet because who she loves is unacceptable to the Empire, that power can be taken away with one wrong step, regardless of her intelligence.<br /><br />(As a side-note, straight-up romance is not a big part of the book, but it’s certainly written very well. I started silently screaming <i>Please kiss!!</i> at Baru and the woman she develops feelings for part-way through the book. Those interactions, charged with both desire and the necessity to be discreet, are imo just as tense as Baru facing off against people who want her dead.)<br /><br />The final thing I’d like to mention is the prose, which I thought was great. Fitting for the story, the book’s written in an… oblique way. The narration is very tightly centred on Baru; her thoughts and feelings, as well as her descriptions of other characters and events, are often given via slightly indirect imagery or are abruptly cut off. This isn’t one of those books with long luscious descriptions, but puzzling through to complete Baru’s thoughts and impressions felt extremely rewarding. A large part of it consists of dialogue, generally a little stilted and formal as it involves characters maneuvering around each other politically, and excellently done.<br /><br />In short, although it’s only January I think I’ve already found one of my top reads of 2018. I saw the ending coming part-way through the book, and I straight-out sobbed, hand over mouth, through the last chapter anyway. Book 2, <i>The Monster Baru Cormorant</i>, should be coming out in October 2018 and I absolutely can’t wait.<br /><br /><b>Recommended for:</b><br /><br />* Fans of political fantasy<br />* Fans of A Song of Ice and Fire (politics) or N.K. Jemisin (sociopolitics)<br />* Fans of more realistic fantasy<br />* People interested in unusual (cold, calculating) protagonists<br />* People interested in explorations of colonialism<br />People searching for great LGBT characters and themes<br />* No, seriously, if you like political fantasy with way more care placed on economics and realistic revolutions than usual, this is the #1 book for you<br />* <s>Fans of romance fantasy</s>"

      "review": "What! WHAT! Cmon. This book delivers on the twists but is unrelenting in it's grim portrayal of human nature. It ends up being a villains journey that reminds me of the excellently portrayed Geder Palliako of the Dagger and the Coin series by Daniel Abraham. The protagonist is a strong, brilliant female who is taken from a newly colonized place to serve a socially and morally repressive empire, that seems like a cross between the Roman and British empires. The motive for Baru lies theoretically in subverting this empire and the means is ostensibly laid out in the title. Despite this, the story shocks in several ways, where Baru ends up screwing over just about every person she encounters in the story, to the point where they are lucky to dead. This has the leader consider the moral conundrum here. And like Breaking Bad, at which point do you stop rooting for the character? To me some of the betrayal seemed capricious, and that is what kept the book from being 5 stars, despite being immensely entertaining-it almost felt like too much death, one twist of the knife too much, but perhaps this was the author's intention, to evoke a feeling of betrayal from the reader for rooting for this character. I wonder if my reaction will be different in the next book, knowing what I am in for, or if the grimdark will be raised a level. I definitely recommend it, it does run to the grimdark side of things. People with non-normative sexuality will have representation in this book but bad things will happen to everyone so be aware that any darling characters can and will have bad things happen. I think people who enjoy villainous arcs will also enjoy this. Anyone who likes Daniel Abraham, Joe Abercrombie will definitely want to pick this one up. In terms of a book that presents interesting gender roles in fantasy, people who like Jacqueline Carey or Kameron Hurley should also check out this author. "

      "review": "<b>\"None of it could be reduced to something as simple as <i>invader</i> and <i>invaded.</i><br />Baru saw in the city what she saw in herself. The two-faced allegiances, the fearful monitoring of self and surroundings, the whimpering need to please somehow kneeling alongside marrow-deep defiance. One eye set on a future of glittering subservience, the other turned to a receding and irretrievable freedom.<br />The liquor of empire, alluring and corrosive at once, saturating everything, every old division of sex and race and history, remaking it all with the promise and the threat of power.\"</b><br /><br />An absolute, unquestionable 5/5 stars. <br /><br /><i>The Traitor Baru Cormorant</i> is an incredibly detailed and politically charged high fantasy novel, following the development of a young girl, Baru Cormorant, and her journey as her native land is slowly invaded and assimilated by a force called the Empire. <br />Baru is taken to a school established, by the Empire, and there the struggle for reclamation of her heritage, culture and beliefs begins. Baru makes the decision to work for the Empire to bring it down from within, and the book really kicks in at the beginning of her career at 18, as an accountant working for the Empire, in a far northern land called Aurdywynn.<br /><br />The plot kicks off at a break-neck speed, with plot twists and foreshadowing built deep into the story right from the start. There are also startling parallels to imperialism in this book and in the real world, and the worldbuilding was phenomenally established.<br />I adored the minor character's as well as the major ones, and the friendships that Baru slowly begins to make (a hard task considering how politically fraught and delicate Baru's position constantly is), along with the inclusion of a beautiful slow-burn romance that I didn't expect to end up loving as much as I did.<br /><br />Complicated, large questions of cultural colonialism and assimilation are included along with smaller ones, such as the scale of personal sacrifice, and how far Baru is willing to go, and to lose, to fight for her people, and against the Empire. <br /><br />Both race and sexuality are hugely important factors in Baru's journey; Baru's identity was nurtured in a culture that has very little societal boundaries regarding both, and having to suppress both her natural heritage and her attraction to women to succeed in her position within the Empire becomes part of the emotional centre of the book. I was truly impressed with the way that cultural trauma is handled and carried through with not just Baru, but a majority of the other character's in the book as well.<br /><br />I was constantly taken by surprise by the plot twists that the author KEPT throwing towards the reader, and while I could almost never guess where the plot was going (except for one major one that was set up from the start), nothing was ever implemented into the novel for shock value. <br /><br /><i>The Traitor Baru Cormorant</i> is a definite read for anyone ANYWHERE. Well-written and gut wrenching, even though it takes you through the full emotional spectrum at least three times it is more than one worth picking up.<br /><br />(And I can't wait for the sequel!!!!!)"

      "review": "\"This is the truth. You will know because it hurts.\"<br /><br />Consider this a warning, which fortunately shows up near the beginning of the book. This book is true. And it is painful. First, the truth. This may be a secondary world fantasy with invented nations and cultures, though no magic or inhuman races, but it's really about the mechanisms of colonization and subjugation (but also civilization). Stepping back into a pretend world rather than using Britain or Rome as examples lets the author make the dilemma of the conquered more clear without the distraction of worrying about getting British policy in 1850's India exactly right. It also let's him make the empire more obviously evil ( the biggest marker of that evil at the beginning of the book is that they hate \"the gays\" which is a bit flavor of the decade, but it works and later on you begin to see just how evil they really are). The main character is the titular Baru Cormorant, a young woman from a newly occupied colony (not conquered, oh no, they never do that, just annex with treaties and trade) of the Imperial Republic, better known as the Masquerade. Baru is a savant, a genius of economics, raised in a Masquerade school, trained to become part of the mechanism of empire but never able to forget her own culture and it's beauty now crushed beneath the ruthlessness of empire. She is sent north to help subdue a rebellious province, where the vast bulk of the story takes place. What Baru does there is illustrate exactly how effective the mechanisms of empire truly are. As she says at one point \"It's not what they do to you, it's what they make you do to yourself\".<br /><br />And then the pain. This book will hurt you. Because it is meant to and because you may well find yourself asking along with Baru how you could deny something you <i>knew</i> to be true. Because the inevitable destination is laid out for you to see right from the start, but you will deny it. You want Baru to succeed, to break free, to run and hide with her lover, a rebellious Duchess (yeah, it's a lesbian romance, get over it, it's not something the book really dwells on and neither should you). You want to believe in choices, in triumph, in victories. But getting there might mean redefining just what you mean by victory and the price paid (this book is about economics after all) might be far too high. <br /><br />This is apparently the first book of a series, though honestly, it could stand alone.

      "review": "This is an incredibly written, intricate, slow moving political drama that I wasn’t sure about at first. There’s a lot of information about the locations and character roles that you need to know, but there is incredible world building. The writing took my breath away at some parts because it‘s so poignant, and every single line is important to the overall plot, even if you don’t realize it right away.<br /><br />This story is ultimately about Baru’s struggle with humanity - how far she will go to get what she wants and do what she thinks is right. She is such a well developed character, as are all of the other players in this book. Every character is believable and has their own distinct role.<br /><br />I also like how the author incorporated LGBTQ+ themes; sexual orientation is used in the world building for characters to struggle against a regime that opposes same sex relationships, but it doesn’t feel like a cheap plot device. There are layers to the issues gay and lesbian characters face, same sex relationships are woven into the history of the different countries/regions, and the main character deals with her own sexuality as well. I think it was really well done.<br /><br />I’m super impressed with this author and the story he told. I don’t usually read books like this but I’m glad my friend forced me to read it because this was totally worth it in the end. Readers are never sure what Baru is going to do next, and there are twists and turns that really mess with you. The first half is a little slow, but it does pick up once readers are immersed in Baru’s world. I’d recommend this for fans of political dramas or high fantasy!"

      "review": "Holy shit. I am destroyed. Not sure why I slept on this for so long, but that teaches me not to make judgements on a book based on what I hear beforehand. I just kept being reminded of how dark this was and thought it wasn't for me, but I was wrong!<br /><br />Despite having similarities with some of my favourite books (A Memory Called Empire, The Locked Tomb series), this was a very different experience. It's dark as hell, so it was good to be warned of this. But everything was there for a reason. I was really impressed with the author's depiction of the Masquerade empire. How it indoctrinates Baru and doesn't truly give her any other choices. The way consume their colonies, stifle their cultures, what they do to those who won't conform...at first I thought it was too much, but I quickly realised that diluting the empire would defeat the point of this series. It draws upon real world examples, like Baru's island home being renamed once fully colonised. That one hit close to home.<br /><br />Baru starts her career as an Imperial Accountant which, as someone familiar with accountancy, I absolutely loved. The writing doesn't shy away from getting technical with economics and accountancy, and later on the war preparation and battles. I've never read anything so realistically logistical before. Maybe this comes down to opinion whether you enjoy that or not. I wouldn't blame anyone for finding it too detailed at this point. Personally I thought it gave the book realism. And it is detailed at the <i>right</i> moments, while also knowing when to take a 'bird's eye view' of the action for balance and to keep the plot moving. <br /><br />There are <i>a lot</i> of names, regions, languages and cultures to remember. One of the questions I wrote to myself at the start was \"will the book emphasise the important ones so it gets less confusing?\" My answer is, mostly. You do end up remembering who and what everything is in the end. There's a map that helps and I do enjoy the mental work of keeping track of it all. The side characters (the dukes) aren't too developed, but this made sense to me because that's how Baru sees them. <i>\"The same mistake Baru always made. Assuming that Nayauru was hers to court, a playing piece to be taken and deployed. Not a player of her own\"</i>. <br /><br />I went into this already expecting to love the main character Baru, because the book kept being recommend by fans of The Locked Tomb series. She's fascinating. Despite all her manipulations and plots I found it easy to connect with her. She's <i>so</i> compelling - the books nails her conflicted feelings about losing herself in the empire's will and battling to temper her sexual identity despite her true emotions. Baru joins Harrowhark Nonagesimus in my exalted ranks of Ultimate Disaster Lesbians.<br />And the chemistry between Baru and Tain Hu was absolutely scorching. The atmosphere, the tension! I feel these are aspects in writing that are hard to get right and I often find myself disappointed. But this book delivered. It made the ending all the more devastating. <br /><br />I'm giving this 4.5 stars for now, but as always with a series, I might change it later. Also for some reason I thought this was a trilogy and have now discovered there is a fourth and final book being written. And that the third book came out in 2020 so the next isn't due for a while. Ow. Another wait for me to agonise over!"

But ultimately, here’s why I stopped:<br /><br />- it’s readable but the pacing is weird (like in one paragraph, 3 years suddenly pass) <br /><br />- the supporting characters are acting more and more unrealistic in service of what I think the author wants the main arc to be<br /><br />- I feel a little weird about the author - apparently a cis man - writing a closeted queer woman’s experience?? I definitely give him props for including queer characters, and it’s done well, but exploring her struggle with her sexuality feels a bit forced"

The author left the truly brutal ending wide open for sequels and is pretty clearly angling for a GoT style TV series, which is fine with me. The protagonist was amazing and the story is chock full of intrigue and plenty of strong and nuanced female and queer characters. Even the battles (usually my least favorite part of any book about a rebellion) were riveting. Highly recommended to any fans of fantasy (although there is no magic as such) dystopia, political fiction and gender/queer studies.<br /><br />Reread: the middle is muddled with the war stuff but I sobbed for the last 40 minutes again.

I agree that it's playing the queer tragedy trope poorly, though.<br /><br />The main character's an accountant who joins the civil service of a colonial power in order to subvert it. I love the premise, and I love the sheer amount of foreshadowing in the book. The author does a really good job of imposing a sense of doom over the whole story, and when the blow finally lands, it hurts no less for how expected it is.<br /><br />on re-read, I still really like how the plot weaves together into a final tragic event. I also love that inflation and bookkeeping are the main powers that Baru has. The plot takes a long time to kick off, though, and the initial few years in Aurdwynn kind of drag."

      "review": "Reread in April of 2019:<br />I reread this book on audio in 2019. I enjoyed it more this time around but I still couldn't connect with the second half of the book that is mostly political intrigue. For some reason, I completely zone out during all the meetings that Baru has with the rebels. <br /><br />I talk about the reread some in my wrap-up video: <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" href=\"https://youtu.be/Qe1prVghxVQ\">https://youtu.be/Qe1prVghxVQ</a><br /><br />Increased rating from a 1 to a 2.<br /><br />Original Review:<br />This book is a rollar coaster of a ride and not in a good way. This book went from something I wasn’t feeling, to something I liked, to something I hated, to something I quit, to something I gave another shot, and finally to something I disliked. Initially DNF'd at 65% but then finished it.<br /><br />The Traitor Baru Cormorant is a fantasy novel that likes to focus on the big picture. It is a book about a woman that is in charge and not a coming of age story. Because of this, we get a very bird’s eye view on the tactics that Baru uses to gain power. This is an extremely tactical heavy book that focuses on the grand strategy of the economy and the alliances between Duchys. The explanations and descriptions of large scale conflicts, that would take many chapters in other books, are paired down to a few pages in this book. This is considered a geopolitical fantasy book.<br /><br />Baru is the main accountant of an entire continent and she knows that money rules all. Baru’s past is a broken past, where her father was killed for being with her other father, and her homeland’s culture was replaced by a new sterile empire that doesn’t accept same sex relationships. Baru, being gay herself and angry that her father was killed for his relationship with her other father, decides to try to bring down the The Empire of Masks from within, so she takes the accountant job. Baru must use her intelligence to navigate the landscape of the Aurdwynn continent that has many small rulers that own their own land. Using her position as the main accountant, she seizes power, and tries to reshape Aurdwynn how she sees fit.<br /><br />Basically, imagine if the chairwoman of the Federal Reserve was sent to Afghanistan to try to fix Afghanistan’s many faction issues by using economic principals.<br /><br />There are some great ideas in this book. I absolutely love the idea of conquest by culture instead of weapons. I found this idea to be refreshing in the fantasy market. I also liked the basic premise of this story quite a bit, a girl wanting to work within the empire she hates, to become powerful enough to bring it down. I also really liked the tactics she used as far as economical strategies to seize power. I found the struggle of her being a gay woman, of color, and of a civilization that is looked down upon, to be fascinating, because the empire she is trying to gain power in hates her type of people. Lastly, I like that Baru was an intelligent character that showed she was intelligent by thinking up ingenious strategies and tactics.<br /><br />The bottom line is that I just didn’t care for this book much though. My first main issue is that these type of books, that feature a top down approach to storytelling, just aren’t relatable to me. When the main character is someone that starts the book in a high position of power(O.K 50 pages in but still) there just isn’t much of a struggle for me to connect to. Sure, her background is bad, but it is told in such a rushed way, that I couldn’t feel any empathy towards Baru. In fact, there were maybe 2 scenes in the entire book that I felt any kind of emotion towards Baru.<br /><br />The book feels like the wikipedia article of a longer book series. There are so many rulers, places, and cultural names thrown at the reader, but with very little substance to actually hang these names in your memory. It is only giving you this large overview, seen through the eyes of Baru, but most of the time I felt like I was treading water keeping up with who is who. I never really got a chance to get comfortable with these characters and make mental references of their character in my mind. I wanted more scenes that explored who Baru was underneath her mask. The private scenes between Baru and Tain Hu(her closest ally and love interest) were great, but they were just so few.<br /><br />I just did not like the way this book was written. My biggest issue was the lack of describing who was talking in conversations. So we get thrown two dozen names within about 10 pages, and we get no mental reference of an interesting scene involving these characters, so when we finally do have a scene with Baru talking to ruler 1 out of 12, the author decides to rely heavily on pronouns to describe who is talking. Not only that, many dialogue sentences have no he said, she said, or character said. What ended up happening, is that I was flipping back to the previous page to try to remember who Baru was even talking to. This was extremely annoying. Now, other readers that have a stronger focus while reading might not struggle with this issue, and my average intelligence might have had an issue keeping up with who was who, but I still can’t imagine any editor allowing the state of these scenes to be released like this.<br /><br />There was such a lack of description during scenes that I found it very hard to get lost in the reading. The picture in my minds eye was so sparse. I guess the best way to explain the way this was written is to take WWII. Individual stories, of individual soldiers struggling in the war are interesting to me. Reading about Stalingrad, or one particular battle is interesting to me, and I feel like I’m learning strong details. The Traitor Baru Cormorant is more akin to reading an overview of the entirety of World War II from the perspective of the general responsible for an entire theater of operation. It is a story of people playing chess and not the story of an individual chess piece, and I enjoy stories of the knight or the rook over the story of the “white side.” This one wasn’t for me but a lot of people seem to love it. Pick it up, check it out, and see if you like the writing style before you buy it.<br /><br /><b>1/5 <br /><br />Plot – 3(Good)<br /><br />Characters – 1(Weak)<br /><br />Setting/World Building – 2(O.K.)<br /><br />Writing Style – 1(Weak)<br /><br />Heart &amp; Mind Aspect – 1(Weak)</b>"

      "review": "I was so close to DNFing this one, but I pushed through to the end. It was so disappointing, because for the first 100 pages or so, I thought for sure this was going to be 5 stars. I really enjoy political fantasy (I don't know if that's a thing), it's probably my favorite type. I think it's interesting to read about politics and political machinations, and the fact that this book explicitly brought economics into it was really great. But then things happen, and it just fell apart for me. It turned more into military fantasy, and many long descriptions of battles and moving people around, including a huge cast of nobility we never get to know or care about. Because we didn't get to know characters, there was no emotional core, motivations didn't make sense, and any impact events could have had fell flat for me. <br /><br /><input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"spoiler__control\" aria-label=\"The following text has been marked spoiler.

I say this because there are some similarities (that are things I normally seek out):<br /><br />1. Political based, with complex relationships between different nations<br />2. No magic, in a different world from ours<br />3. Oppressive governments, especially toward homosexuality<br />4. Gray morality/characters<br />5. Real world themes (rise of fascism in Donnely's case, here it's imperialism/colonialism)<br /><br />So I was super excited to read this because in the first 50 pages, I was on board with Baru's story, and I was drawn to a world where this impact of colonialism was going to be critiqued. Because Baru is attracted to women, I also expected the story to head in a specific direction (since the Masquerade aka the colonizers forbid homosexuality). Here's where the story really lost me. In <i>Amberlough</i>, the emotional crux of the story is really the relationship between two characters. They make some very questionable decisions to try to protect each other from the regime, some honestly horrible decisions that only bring about more misery. But you never lose sight of why they make those decisions. There's an empathy that's written in that <i>Baru</i> just totally lacks. <br /><br />I did see that there was supposed to be sexual tension between Baru and Tain Hu, but it never felt genuine, partly because Baru was just so closed off. When Baru betrays Tain Hu at the end, it's also just so yuck. It made me feel like no one in this book acts like a real human would. I know it's grimdark, and maybe that genre just isn't for me and I need to stop even trying. <br /><br />I figured at about page 200 that Baru was most likely still working for the Masquerade, and that also made it very difficult to care about anything. We have to follow all these ridiculous names (I'll get to that in a sec) and places, without exactly understanding why Baru has supposedly turned. She spent so long obsessing about freeing her people, why had she suddenly decided to instead try to become the ruler of the resistance in this place she has no ties to? Unless of course, she hasn't really joined the resistance. So why should I care about the endless duchies and dukes/duchesses when I know it's all pointless? And because Baru is so distant so the author can try to hide the twist, nothing makes sense! Nothing she does ever feels real, other characters also don't feel like they have real motivations. It just feels like a lot of maneuvering so the author can insert a twist ending and also kill off the love interest. Which I love tragic stories, I really do. But to have an impact, I have to actually care. And this just didn't happen here. <br /><br />I also agree with some other reviewers that there's something a little icky with how homosexuality is treated. The Masquerade is so cruel, and then also having the love interest murdered at the end? It felt like it was all just for extra darkness. Again, I feel like Donnely handled similar themes so much better.<br /><br />Additionally, Baru just seemed too good at everything. She never read as a young woman of 18-22 or so. Ever. Thankfully, there's no \"gross male writer trying to write a woman\" which I super appreciate. What I'm more getting at is it never made sense to me that she was so young, given such a position of power, then expected to secretly rebel, but really be a traitor to the rebellion. The whole setup is so far fetched and not how governments actually work and it drove me crazy. She should have at least had to go to some sort of university first. What super oppressive regime is just like, hey! we'll train you for a few years on your recently conquered island country, where we think you're all terrible sinners because men married each other and formed families with multiple other men/women, and you're only barely 18 and totally untested, but we'll send you to be in charge of the finances of this totally foreign country and also expect you to rebel, but really still be on our side, and that's the real test!!! I'm sorry, I just don't buy it.</label><br /><br />One last thing I want to touch on: What is with the names in this book? I'm totally ok with fantasy names, I just wanted them to have some internal consistency. People from certain places would likely have similarly structured names, and ways of pronouncing certain letters. Think about the structure of Russian names (people often referred to by first name and patronymic, many nicknames), or how \"J\" is pronounced in English John vs. Spanish Juan, or how Asian names are transliterated for English speaking countries. Think about how colonization in our world forced (and still forces) anglisized names on people. Stuff like that is so important to a world. The names here are all over the place. There was a huge, lost opportunity to have names mean something. We kind of see it with the renaming of Baru's home country, but it could have gone so much further if individual's names were also brought into it. If there had been a consistent formation and spelling to Masquerade names that they force on their conquered peoples, but then you have those people sometimes using or mentioning their old names, there'd be a much stronger message here. Instead, you just have random formations and spellings everywhere and I was constantly like, but how is this \"x\" pronounced? <br /><br />And that's my real problem with this book. It's boring in some ways I can't stand (military stuff), and then is also unrealistic in characterization and world building."

I guessed the ending probably less than 30 percent in and based on the ending of this book I am sure I can predict the next two books as well and it's a fine ending to me but the thing is I don't really care. At the start I enjoyed how clever I found Baru; but at the end I realized I just didn't care. I didn't care if she was clever, I didn't care about her romance, I just felt everything being so drawn out made me 100 percent apathetic to my core. I understand every characters logic and reasoning completely but I DON'T CARE the author did not spend enough time indebting me to these people to create any feelings in me because the characters did not feel deep enough for me. Baru's anger never feels angry enough her love never loving enough - guess what Baru you are a sociopath and a boring one at that! The dialogue wasn't clever enough to keep me intrigued, the characters I liked were taken out early and I really can't imagine trying to struggle through the next book. I think people who like reading history textbooks or like books where they don't need a character to root for will love this; but personally I just found it as not a match for me."

ESPECIALLY AT THE END. it does not shy away from the horrors of colonialism, and how much of yourself it forces you to give up. it was painful, obviously, but i appreciate when a book doesn't handle you with kid gloves. it's authentic. it's important. for all that i love the soft fluffy stuff, these books matter just as much.<br /><br />and okay, yeah, the worldbuilding was obviously very thought out, but good worldbuilding falls apart when not bolstered by good characters. i cannot count the number of times a book has had a good premise and the author proceeded to completely fail at making me care about these characters half as much as the author themself did. happy to report this wasn't the case here. <br /><br />BARU!!!!!!!!!!!!! my most dearly beloved favorite kind of character archetype strikes again!! look i already said my whole bit down there but like. an incredibly intelligent and calculating woman who cultivates an image of herself as cold and unfeeling for her own safety, but feels so deeply that it motivates her every action. and she's a LESBIAN! and she's a BUTCH LESBIAN! this is the sound of me clapping and cheering and cartwheeling with joy! god. i love her. straight up never thought i would love an accountant this much. admittedly i didn't get quite as attached to the whole side cast because well there were a lot of them. but tain hu and muire lo did get me right in the heart. guh. not to be one of those annoying people who looks at a story that was always going to be a tragedy and goes \"but what if they were happy...\" but what if. they were happy...<br /><br />parting thoughts. that bit about how they'll let prisoners escape from jail and then recapture them so they learn that there's no escape? and then when. yeah. that'll stick with me i think.<br /><br />currently reading review: haven't finished it yet so i can't write a full review but i just need to say: so many reviews are saying what a bold choice it was to create an unlikeable protagonist and how baru is a character you love to hate and stuff like that. and i need to say i CANNOT RELATE!!! i LOOOOOOVVVEEEE baru in all of her fucked up messy mean cold calculating glory!!! this is my favorite kind of character ever! as you probably know! she was tailor fucking made for me! also like. i was half expecting her to be this emotionless husk of a person from the way some people talk about her but she's literally having Inconvenient Feelings all the damn time. come on folks you know if she was a guy you couldn't go two feet without tripping over a thirstpost. anyway i love baru i think she's amazing rip to everyone else i guess but you're wrong."

      "review": "3.5 Stars<br /><br />I loved the conceit of this novel, I just never really got behind the execution. <br /><br />The gist of it is this...Baru Cormorant is a precocious child living in a pre-industrial civilization with her mother and two fathers. Life changes for her when her nation signs a treaty with the Empire of Masks which comes to subsume her culture. The empire preaches that homosexuality and polygamy is wrong, and one of her fathers is killed off-screen. Baru is a prodigy and mathematical genius and becomes the protegee of an empire merchant who gives the impression he's more than he seems. She is also secretly a lesbian, which is abhorrent to the ideals of the empire. She vows to rise far in the empire and destroy it from within, saving (or avenging) her culture in the process.<br /><br />Baru takes the civil service test and is sent not to the heart of the empire but to be an accountant in a different difficult to rule colony made up of several competing duchies on the brink of open rebellion. She is drawn into the politics and various intrigues of this nation and must choose whether to prove herself higher into the ranks of the empire or take a stand against the empire.<br /><br />There's quite a bit of court intrigue here and a deliciously hurtful twist at the end, its also always great to see a complex queer protagonist, but honestly the writing just didn't do it for me. It's overly verbose and extremely dialogue-heavy. A lot of the strategic victories won by Baru didn't seem particularly clever to me because I didn't have the information I needed about the situation and the culture to come to appreciate Baru's intelligence in coming to them. A great novel will set the stage and leave little clues about the next step the genius character will take but waits to reveal what that step is creating an \"aha\" moment...this book didn't really do that. We're told that Baru is a strategic genius and we are meant just to go along with it (Its also possible that the author did attempt to foreshadow and I just missed it because of clunkyness of the writing.)<br /><br />Overall, this is a decent read if you don't mind an extremely plotty fantasy novel that's light on magic and heavy on intrigue and tactical manoevering and gets quite confusing, especially if you don't mind some really clunky writing. It was probably a bit much for me, but I have to give it props for that suckerpunch of an ending."

      "review": "DNF at 85%.<br /><br />A lot of good elements in this book! Just sadly not for me.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- I found the prose genuinely beautiful! It did sometimes veer into the purple for me, (e.g., \"she found the marines already ashore, ranked in red like a leash of foxes come up out of a forest of salt and mast, faceless in their enameled steel masks\"), but the purpleness was not too frequent.<br />- The exploration of \"assimilating into the culture that's colonizing your culture\" -- here I'd contrast this with A Memory Called Empire in particular. I think that The Traitor Baru Cormorant does this better, perhaps because we actually spend some time in the main character's home.<br />- Queer lead -- There isn't just a contained romance plot as other books might have; rather, throughout the book, Baru's orientation is shown in a more holistic way by how she / the close narrator describes other women.<br /><br />Personal dislikes:<br />- Political intrigue -- For me, too much focus was on the convoluted mechanics of characters' schemes, as opposed to the characters themselves. It was difficult for me to be interested in any of the secondary characters, to the point that I still cannot distinguish between Lyxaxu and Oathsfire, and had only surface level impressions of Ihuake, Erebog, Pinjagata, etc. This in turn led to me skipping past the book's climax.<br />- Plot summary -- After the first half or so, the book zooms out to a much much larger scale. Months' worth of troop movements and military scuffles are described in brief, dry paragraphs interspersed with scenery descriptions (beautifully written, but no longer emotionally impactful), and the rare scene that more closely observes the main characters.

      "review": "When Baru is a young girl, the Masquerade Empire arrives at her home island of Taranoke and subsequently become the oppressive colonisers of her people. Baru is taught their rules, their culture, and their science through the Empire’s school. However, for what the Empire has done to her family and her people, she will not forgive. She intends to get her revenge from within, by rising through the ranks of the Empire. She is sent to be the imperial accountant in Aurdwynn, a land of many duchies warring with one another and a land that the Empire cannot entirely control with this constant feuding and rebellion. Baru discovers that the land is on the brink of rebellion once again and she must either stop it or join it. <br /><br /><b>[Characters]</b><br />Baru is the lead character and the one whose POV we follow. As such, she is the one with the most depth in the story. Baru is an incredibly morally grey character, and one goes by logic over emotion. But this doesn’t mean she is cold and calculating to a T. Baru does show emotion and the things she does and what she witnesses does have an effect on her. She is driven by the love for her family and her people and perhaps that makes her more morally grey. Though Baru is a genius, she doesn’t constantly win. She has doubts. She has little poisonous thoughts that at times flirt with sociopathy and which she must battle with. And while Baru is smart, she is reminded that she isn’t the only smart one in the room. For all of this, though Baru made decisions that were not ‘right,’ I fell in love with her as a character because of this depth we see. No decision she made ultimately felt out of character.<br /><br />As for the other characters, with them we get varying degrees of depth. Honestly, I felt like this book could have been a little longer, just so we could see more of the Dukes in particular as some of them just felt like a name, or we are only given secondhand characterisation. Because of this, I didn’t particularly care for most of them and that lack of emotional connection was kind of a bummer considering how much I liked Baru. <br /><br /><b>[Plot]</b><br />The plot initially follows Baru’s childhood, but the main bulk of the book is about her time in Aurdwynn. The plot and interactions within the plot are character heavy and for the first around 2/3rds there is much more focus on politics and navigating aspects like economics, especially in the middle section. This is great for someone like me who loves heavily character focused books and exploration of the more mundane, but for someone looking for something more action packed, they’ll probably be bored that nothing is seemingly happening. It does pick up again in the last 1/3rd, however, with a lot happening rather quickly -- maybe a bit too quickly. <br /><br /><b>[Setting/Worldbuilding]</b><br />This story is set in a secondary world, rather than a fantastical one. If there is magic, it’s not immediately present in this book and is yet to be seen. Baru must use her own mind and wits to overcome obstacles and against people doing the same. And as this is a secondary world, there is a lot of worldbuilding in terms of place names, people, and some history. At the beginning of the story you’re hit with a lot but there are no real info dumps and the story doesn’t hold your hand. Though it could be a tad confusing -- especially as I had trouble pronouncing some of these names -- in the end I appreciated it as I eventually caught on. There are quite a few things that are implicit in dialogue, action, and internal thought that the reader has to pay some attention to and catch either by riddling it out or relying on the context of what is happening now and comparing that to past events. I liked this too as it kept me engaged, yet others might find it frustrating and confusing as it feels like you might have missed something. <br /><br />Fantastically, this story features LGBT+ themes and non-traditional family and romantic structures. Polyamory is there and it’s great to see. It also had other elements that pleased me; just small things you don’t usually see in fantasy where traditional tropes and characterisations of (binary) genders are boringly pseudo-medieval-modern and are consistently so. For example, there is mention of a society whose cultural notions of gender fall outside the typical binary. There’s also mention of men wearing makeup rather than women (one-sidedly reminiscent of 18th century men’s makeup habits?). <br /><br /><b>[Prose]</b><br />Good, workable prose. Not lyrical or beautiful, but it didn’t need to be and probably would have taken away from the story if it were. There was a readiness to it that puts you in the story and gets on with it. However, the story did suffer from white-room syndrome at times, where the exposition was sparse and I had to put the work in to imagine what was happening which made the world feel a little less alive at points. <br /><br />Battle scenes and the like take on an almost omnipresent POV which I felt was unfortunate because a battle might be skimmed over and I would have liked to be among the blood and mess a bit more. The dialogue also suffered occasionally as could it feel stilted and some of the characters lacked a defining voice, thus making them blend. <br /><br /><b>[Enjoyment]</b><br />I loved this book. There’s really not much other way to put it. I pretty much read this in one sitting and was enthralled the whole way through. The characters and especially the themes in this book really engaged me and made the story matter. The injustices felt real and even though it hurt to read at times, I wanted to know more and still do. Many people treat/treated this like a standalone, but there are way too many loose threads hanging for me to feel comfortable with that conclusion. That’s why I’m eagerly anticipating <b>The Monster Baru Cormorant</b> and you can bet your arse I’m gonna pre-order it. <br /><br />Excellent debut.<br />"

      "review": "Wunderkind lesbian insinuates herself into office in homophobic empire.<br /><br />Not the usual fantasy protagonist, who grows up in colonial space “knowing a little of the structure of trade: arbitrage, currency exchange, import and export” (17). As a child, she mirrors the question that animates <i>Guns, Germs, and Steel</i>: “why do they come here and make treaties? Why do we not go to them?” (27). She’d nevertheless fit right in with the dominant imperial polity, which is “remorseless not out of cruelty or hate but because it was too vast and too set on its destiny to care for the small tragedies of its growth” (30)—very much Benjamin’s lament in the 9th thesis on the philosophy of history. (Also: “Every moment is an edict spoken by its past. The past is the real tyranny” (336).) It is totally the Marxist principle that all that is solid melts into air, stated as “the tide is coming in,” “the ocean has reached this little pool. There will be turbulence, and confusion, and ruin”—“when the joining is done there will be a sea for you to swim in” (31). Yay? In this context, the empire will “justify any brutality” (147), including the dumb rules on sex and gender and orientation, in the “lives our sanitation and discipline will save.” The imperial discipline remakes its possessions in that “there will come a time […] when this city will not remember a time before” the empire (187); it is a good example of how ideology works in the warning that it’s not what the empire does to you that you should fear but rather what “it convinces you to do to yourself” (id.). The goal is accordingly not only to “rule them” but instead to make them “want to be ruled”: “The chains are not yet invisible” (188). The logical extreme is a conflation of oikos and polis in the laws of household management, with the ultimate goal of having oikos and polis coincide without remainder, a perfect totalitarianism: <blockquote>When the work is complete, when our hegemony is total, no one and nothing will act without our consent. By volition will be synonymous for by decree. The law of the Empire will live within every soul and cell, there will be no more pain or waste. Only harmony. (370)</blockquote> It is however an acknowledged problem, a homogenization effect, as noted by Louis Menand otherwise: “What use a republic of nations if we make them all the same?” (210). Manifest therefore that the empire itself is western bourgeois liberalism, “born in revolt against a degenerate aristocracy” (32). <br /><br />The empire is fugly, teaching her “the words <i>sodomite</i> and <i>tribadist</i> and <i>social crime</i> and <i>sanitary inheritance</i>, and even the mantra of rule: <i>order is preferable to disorder</i>” (25). The empire “thought of families as a man and a woman, thought of the mother and father as fixed necessities” (298), even in the face of evidence that others “had always practiced other ways—useful ways, methods that liberated strong hands for labor and war” (id.). Their gender ideas are dumb, but they are sufficiently familiar to us in believing that it is a “scientific fact” that “young women express numerous hysterias and neuroses” (32). Familiar also the refrain that “the man gets to brag and the woman’s got to be silent” (36). These likewise include the sort of snide belief that military conquest constitutes a vindication of policies and practices, gloating over “yesteryear’s methods, the losers of history” (39). They are sufficiently arrogant to believe themselves the “heart and mind of the world” (46)—but those in the know also regard parliament as “theatre for the mob” (70)—meet the new boss, same as the old boss? (We see that the revolution itself is also familiar: “Days of terror, as the uprising turned on itself in a glioma of constant cannibalistic treachery” (139).)<br /><br />Despite the empire’s fugliness, it does institute an anti-discrimination policy in the wearing of masks: “when you wear a mask, your wits matter” (29), rather than sex, wealth, ethnicity—“you can be what you desire, if you are disciplined in your actions and rigorous in your thoughts” (id.). Masks are for “acts of service” (id.), such as when soldiers are on duty, representatives are in parliament, and teachers are in class. This does not extend to orientation, of course—and that doesn’t help the protagonist, insofar as she identifies as non-heteronormative.<br /><br />The action unfolds when mathematical prodigy protagonist is appointed as imperial auditor over an unruly province; she understands that the “books would record a web of debt and credit, and from this web she could map out the arrangement of power” in the province (67); “no ship could be hired, no land developed, no army raised without some money changing hands” (id.), and the account books were to be her “spyglass, her map, her sword and edict.” Refreshing in the same way that Bakker’s first novel resolves its major plot in a learned debate between violent people rather than in violence. In reviewing some books, for instance, the protagonist discerns the “simplest forms of fraud and corruption betrayed themselves here, in the balance of payments” (107). In overseeing the books, it is also part of the imperial resolution of the trolley problem inherent in economic management: “she had already killed, hadn’t she?” (231), regarding taxation to the point of malnutrition for some—but this is weighed against the litany of Monty Python’s “what have the Romans ever done for us?”—“the inoculations, the sewers, the roads, the schools, the wealth” (id.). These things are by horrible contrast also the empire’s “most powerful military discovery” (244), “made early in its history: battle don’t kill soldiers. Plague and starvation killed soldiers, the slow, structural forces of conflict” (id.). Otherwise, a spectre of the RSB in “the armies did not kill each other, they broke each other, that the day would be won when one army believed it could not survive. A matter of deception, of conviction, of lies made true through performance. Like everything else” (352).<br /><br />Overall a meditation on what it means to serve. Cf. Agamben Homo Sacer IX: “How fundamentally satisfying to have a knowledgeable subordinate—like a little auxiliary mind” (48). But: “was it really slavery if the slave was grateful? If that gratitude had been hammered into the alloy of his being?” (168)—which is the question presented by <i>Brave New World</i>, of course. Likely a person’s subjective experience must be considered irrelevant in the determination of whether slavery exists for precisely the reason that slavery distorts the mind—indeed, what might an “auxiliary mind” possibly be permitted to think of its condition of servitude? This should apply with full force and effect to the protagonist herself.<br /><br />Effective pathos, plenty of war and bravado, the normal competent serial speculative fare.<br /><br />Recommended for readers guilty of hedonic sociopathy or hereditary misconjugation, those who speak of the transience of worldly authority, and screamers of axioms of nihilist self-negation.<br />"

Or maybe, to close the circle, it was just my inattention.<br /><br />I'll give this to the end of the trilogy to decide my final rating; I certainly recommend the book for eye-reading instead of audio, if possible, as the narrator is just too smooth and the tale flies by."

      "review": "*train book to Nuremberg*<br /><br />This is my third? Maybe fourth? Reread of Baru but god it hits harder each time.<br /><br />The Baru books are very much a ~not for everyone~ series but for me it’s everything. It’s bleak, tragic, and a straight up story of growing up and surviving in ANY way you can. This is not happy ending chosen one fantasy this is war, colonialism, destruction, the very worst parts of humanity, and a girl who swears to make it better but must become just as bad in order to try. This book and series is very much character driven and thank god it is I love Baru so much. She was one of the first adult fantasy characters I felt I really “got” and she has stayed one of my favorites even now. The first book does get very heavy into world building and narrative but it sets up the plot so well. It’s the least dark and intense of the three so far but it’s a perfect opener that hooks you in with ideals and hope before the inevitable corruption. The fact that literally no one has heard of these still make me mad. (Is it because it came out in 2015 with a badass morally questionable queer woman of color main character in a time where adult fantasy was dominated by white men? Probably 😡)<br /><br />Do you want to feel happy? Don’t read Baru. Do you want to lose your ability for language because the book has made you feel so many complicated emotions in the span of 10 pages? This is your ticket!"

      "review": "Haven't been this hurt by a book in a long time. <br /><br />The highest praise. <br /><br />An alternate-world tale of a young queer islander woman, Baru, who watched her native lands and culture ravaged by colonization, and who dedicates her life to rising through the enemy bureaucracy and destroying them from within. It is rare to see modern books discuss whether the ends can justify the means and explore what happens when the characters answer with a resounding \"yes.\" Baru never dashes in for cut-throat heroics or leads a charge, instead spilling blood with finance, political maneuvers, and conspiracy. <br /><br />A warning that this is a very painful world to be in, feeling often like a Game of Thrones style uber-realism, but with a more diverse cast and where you as the reader are meant to empathize with their pain, instead of being taken for shock and awe. The conquering nation, The Masquerade, believes in a hetero-normative and eugenics-like system of \"science\" that is constantly leading to cruelties against those they conquer and forces Baru to hide her true self throughout the book. In a brilliant stroke of world-building though, the cast is allowed to be diverse in their ethnicity and gender under this system because, as opposed to being a direct analog of the system of white male privileged in our world, their \"Incrastic\" system believes that people of different races should be bred together like dogs to highlight their \"innate\" attributes and then psychologically conditioned for loyalty and obedience. It is a perfectly thread needle to separate this world from ours and still lead us to the obvious parallels with our own history as the antagonists follow their ideals to horrific conclusions. <br /><br />I'm going to need a breather before diving into the second, but I am hooked."

In this day and age, the trope of killing your gays is well overdone. To create a wonderful story about justice, rebellion and self-discovery only to completely destroy it with a cheesy and completely out of character ending. The main character I came to love is the not the girl at the end of the book. It was like the author wanted to go for the biggest shock value possible - instead of making a story about hope and rebellion, a story that could very well be of use in this modern day, let's make it a story about how all hope dies and all the characters die unnecessarily.<br /><br />I have never been so angry to finish a book. I have read books and gone, \"Wow, this is devastating,\" and been jokingly angry at the author. But this is very different. I will not be reading the second book. "

His portrayal of politics and power struggles within his world is fascinating and very well thought out - in particular his use of economics as a governance power mechanism. <br />However, the first half of the book was hard to get into. The second half definitely picked up and was much more compelling and the end was very entertaining and hooked me. But overall the author moves through events quickly - the plot covers a lot of individual events, and while you do end up caring about the protagonist, I didn’t care for some of the side characters as much as I believe I was supposed to. Especially with the ending, I would have expected the book to have evoked a much stronger emotional reaction, but something about the authors pacing and characterizations left me entertained and intellectually stimulated, but much more emotionally detached than I expected. I think this is part of the reason the book falls short of some of its potential. I wish could give half stars- the first half of this book is 3 stars, 2nd half would be four. Because I ended up really enjoying the second half, I have high hopes for the rest of the series. (also love books with gay protagonists!)"

I have ascertained that she is not a hero. I do not know yet whether she is a monster. she grew up in an island that was soon conquered. the story so beautifully explores imperialism and conquering in a way that is more complicated than breathless victories and brave battles. it is also dirtier. more cruel and vicious. <br /><br />Baru is an accountant. this appeals to me, as a student studying finance. i have always had a fascination for money, and this is perhaps what saved the beginning of the story, which is quite dull and slow. it is overly detailed, meticulously slow, and is in tone similar to its exhaustively detailed protagonist. some things were a little chilling, like seeing simple concepts we use and are taught in class weaponized and as tools rather than natural, logic, eventualities. I think that is the point of the story. it has certainly fostered a certain respect and responsibility for economics.<br /><br />this story is different because we usually don't read about Baru, or at least I haven't. we read about the righteous warriors, people fighting battles on the front lines. Baru is not a warrior, and she is often not in the centre of the story. there is action to this story, but it is witnessed or reported to, not often involving Baru. she is often in an office, moving chess pieces, completely in control. <br /><br />I can't not write myself or my feelings of Baru. she is calculating and capricious, selfish and ambitious, observant. it is not her day-to-day behaviour that is dangerous but what she is capable of. that is part of the intrigue, that Baru is capable of betraying all, and it is hard to know what games she plays, especially considering the enormous empire attempting to conquer the world.<br /><br />the action picks up, and although Baru is not sympathetic, some side characters are. the second half of the story is very exciting, and the ending is deeply satisfying. in general, you should read this story not for action, but if you are interested in politics and strategy. (oh, I'm a political science minor and a finance major? no wonder this book worked for me.) it's a little disconcerting to see the deep lack of trust apparent in everyone, and in that sense, I really like this book. <br /><br />many stories are about the faithful and the loyal, and trust is much stronger. I like a story about self-interest. and of course, the ending rips your heart out, but I like that the stakes are high.<br /><br />the five star rating was a mistake. i went to give it four, and my phone instead gave it five, but maybe I'll let it remain that way. a book that leaves me unsettled, that questions revolution and utilitarianism is so fascinating. I would love a sequel, but I wonder how satisfying that can be. I don't know what will happen. that scares me because I know what i want to happen, and it would be marvelous watching the author find a way around his characters. maybe it's impossible, maybe it's mastery. I don't know. <br /><br />if you are interested in the specifics and mechanisms of ruling, in revolution, in moral questions, in the details and in imperfections and a rather realist, even hawkish point of view of the world, you should give this a try. keep reading because it does pay off. the story feels very long, and is deeply, unsettlingly fascinating."

      "review": "I dont think I have ever been so angry at an ending to a book before. It almost cost this book a star, giving me a sensation of the Author pointing and laughing at the reader- 'see, nothing you thought was true, hahaha'. Its not... genuine. (I struggle to find the words to explain my feeling on this, so I might come back to edit this review later, if I stumble on the right words). I feel... betrayed by the ending to this book. <br />It also made me feel... hopeless and helpless. Everything you become invested in and you enjoy doesn't matter, and that sucks.<br />I wanted to drop it and walk away and page 372-373. (In the interest of no spoilers here, I will leave it at that.) I don't think I've struggled through the last (roughly) 30 pages of any book so much as this one. I wish I had stopped on that page with all my heart. (And all the tears on the page).<br />This i believe is direct bias-- i wanted Baru and Hu to be happy and to (for once!) See two women fall in love and be happy against all odds. Its difficult to explain other than to say (one sentence spoiler) but instead I feel that it was much more reminiscent of \"bury your gays\" (specifically, to build up to this relationship/moment so directly to only have this happen like a few pages later, and have it all mean absolutely nothing in the long run, for a character to actively and definitively chose to hate herself and who she is) Almost a token.<br /><br />I would have loved a slower beginning- i wanted to see Tarnoke and its people as a paradise. I wanted to see it as a good reason for the events that Baru did at the end of the book. Maybe just an extra hundred or less pages at the beginning to show (not tell) all that Baru lost, and why it should matter. Rather, I understand only intellectually her motives (for her home and family) but I can't feel it, or sympathize with it. Not for the price that Baru had to pay. <br />(One sentence spoiler) Not for Tain Hu.<br /><br />Many times, the book (especially in the first section) was a bit slow. Maybe its my bias, as I don't comprehend economics at all and found all that stuff (and a lot of detail the author tried to push in that direction) flying over my head. The slow parts never seemed to be the right parts-- here i will explain how paper money is manipulated and built, there I will jump years into the future. There was good detail, but it felt laborious while other things were giant sweeping statements. <br /><br />One minor pet peeve is that pretty much everyone is referred to by their full name every single time, and it just leads to a slight feeling of being a bit stilted or just off, narratively. There didn't seem to be any overarching structure- why some places were chapter breaks while others breaks in the chapter? There didn't seem to be any rhyme or reason for the difference and was just kinda weird and off putting at times.<br /><br />Unrelated but contributing to the high rating despite my hatred and sadness over the ending-- this book says something not-so-veiled about imperialism that I love and could probably rate an essay about."

      "review": "This is a book about colonialism, from the perspective of the colonized. At a very young age, Baru is confronted with a situation where everyone she thought was strong and wise and powerful—her mother, her fathers, the people of her home—is rendered confused and helpless in the face of the strangers who come from afar. The only way to fight the strangers is to learn their secrets, and the only way to learn their secrets is to play by their rules and become one of them.<br /><br />I think what I admire most about this book is the way Baru is presented to the reader. Early in the book it's easy to tell who she is. The writing is more transparent, and her actions are more easily mapped onto the thoughts and feelings behind them. But as Baru gets older, more and more of her is hidden from the reader, because she hides her true self from herself. If you're paying attention, none of her actions will come as a real shock, but she's still grows more impenetrable over the course of the book. Ultimately, the question posed by this story isn't \"Who does Baru betray?\" but \"Who is Baru?\"<br /><br />Edit: I just re-read this to refresh myself for the recently released 3rd book.<br />**There will be SPOILERS after this point**<br /><br />For the most part, this book held up very well on a second reading. I paid much more attention to the hints and foreshadowing for the ending, and I wasn't surprised to see that everything that happens is pretty well established if you're paying attention. The sleight of hand was my favorite part of the book. We are told, repeatedly, what the rebellion is, what Baru is going to do. We are given access to Baru's mind as she takes concrete actions to prepare for her betrayal. But still, while reading it, it's so easy to get lost in the drama of the rebellion, to hope, to really believe that Baru will somehow succeed and become the queen of a free Aurdwynn. Yes, a lot is hidden, but not in a cheap way. What is hidden from the reader is what Baru hides from herself, and she slips up enough times that the final result really shouldn't come as a surprise.<br /><br />One thing that did surprise me was the extent to which the author showed that Tain Hu realized on some level what Baru's plan was but still allowed it to happen. There are a number of key confrontations where Baru almost breaks down and tells her everything, and several times Tain Hu is the one who silences her. This added another layer of depth to the ending, since Tain Hu isn't sacrificing herself for the person she loves, she's sacrificing herself because she has come to believe that Baru's path forward is the only way to free her people.<br /><br />If I have complaints about the book, it's mostly in what isn't shown. A lot of the story is told through summary, introspection, or retrospect. The time skip is one problem here. The only scenes of her life in these few years are of her getting drunk, and then we get to see it all fall apart. A few concrete, in-the-moment scenes would've helped a lot to give a better idea of what her daily life was actually like in those three years. When Tain Hu teaches her to shoot (also told in a flashback only after it becomes relevant) there's this line: \"Baru who in moments of frustration or quiet always turned to the exercises and weights of the Naval System, drew with one easy breath.\" This came as a bit of a surprise to me, since we'd never been shown her doing this. Parts of her life in these year are brought up as they become relevant and it feels like they came out of nowhere. Unfortunately, this becomes a bigger problem in the sequel, <input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"spoiler__control\" aria-label=\"The following text has been marked spoiler. Toggle checkbox to reveal or hide.\" onchange=\"this.labels[0].setAttribute('aria-hidden', !this.checked);\" id=\"16571485-7e37-4284-abb8-28edf3d9e344\" /><label aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"spoiler\" for=\"16571485-7e37-4284-abb8-28edf3d9e344\">when elements of Baru's relationships with Tain Hu and Aminata become major plot points, even though those elements were never developed or mentioned.</label> Too much of the plot progression and character development happens between the pages, instead of on them. This wasn't a major problem. It was an introspective, philosophical book, and in general I think the way it was written was fantastic. I just think a few more details about what happened in those voids would've been welcome.<br /><br />I don't want to be too hard on this book, because I really did love it. While reading it this second time, I often stopped to take notes, and flipped back to reexamine how payoffs were set up, and the whole thing held together perfectly. Small details about Baru's state of mind while she gave some order or made some connection would perfectly foreshadow some major reveal down the line while still maintaining some ambiguity in the moment.<br /><br />A few other things. There are so many times brief descriptions of the environment or a characters' actions worked as metaphors to the larger story. \"Baru turned away and went back into the keep, her steps filthy, accretive, heavy with mire. At the portullis she stopped and began to kick the stone, trying to get herself clean.\" \"The millwheel had been uncoupled from the machinery and it turned in useless creaking circles.\" \"Baru selected another marrow-rich bone and felt for the breakpoint.\" The prose is fantastic, and conveys a lot about the characters through descriptions like these. There are also motifs and symbols that come up again and again, some with obvious direct meanings and some more abstract: the birds, the saber, the purse, the mask."

      "review": "Can I just bury my face in a book and never leave? <br /><br />There are a lot of times I find myself really reluctant to put down a book, either to pause or to finish. There are a lot of times I find myself re-reading books so that I don't have to leave the world the author has spun. I went through every iteration of this with Baru Cormorant: slowing down and soaking up every word, every sentence so as to prolong the experience, re-reading passages at a time, and just plain going back and re-reading chapters. <br /><br />The intro to the book really says it all: \"This is the truth. You'll know because it hurts.\" And boy does it. The ending is like a series of sucker punches one after another until you're just lying there, flat on your back, trying to absorb how you got here and how it ended this way. And you love every second of the pain. I brought this book on vacation and ended up being 20 minutes late to a group dinner because I misjudged timing and absolutely refused to leave until I had finished the book; I probably would have murdered whoever had gotten in my way of reading the last 20 pages by that point. <br /><br />It's painful and stressful at times, but really, the best thrillers, especially political ones and ones that involve revolutions, are. You're not assured that everything will go okay, you don't know that certain people will live, and it makes you want to savor each moment, each line that much more. <br /><br />It's a hard one to assign a genre to: it's not really fantasy or science-fiction, though it definitely takes place in a separate world with many parallels to our own. There's no magic here, and the only traces of science-fiction we have are shadowy experiments referenced, but only tangentially important. Much more important are the political wheelings and dealings of a revolution, of Baru's grasp of power and her rise, all of which are rivetingly human. Her struggles and mistakes and growth are stunningly told. A month and 20 books later, and I still find myself sighing over this book. "

      "review": "Wondering if there is a Gideon the Ninth to Traitor Baru pipeline because I saw this on a list of books to read after GtN. According to testimonies this book was sapphic like GtN.<br /><br />*VERY VAUGE SPOILERS*<br /><br />This is not a lesbian book. There are lesbian characters, it is mentioned a scant few times (briefly) and it being one of Baru’s catalysts for getting revenge, but it is not a lesbian story. There is rampent homophobia throughout the book and unsettling talk of same sex love and how it’s dealt with. Do not read this expecting a sapphic story, happy queers or anything of the sort. Maybe this changes in subsequent books (I haven’t read them) but do not read this with that expectation. <br /><br />This is also a VERY dark book, especially the past part. Dickenson spares no gritty detail describing the devastating effects of colonization and how it can wipe out a culture within years, cultural eugenics, or the nastier details or war. There are no tender feelings against a sunset here. The ending was especially hard and somewhat painful. This is not a bad thing, not all stories are meant to leave you feeling fuzzy, but this book does not provide the good kind of hurt you’d expect from a novel.<br /><br />That aside, I neither loved nor hated this book. Baru is a fun protagonist, calculating and ruthless and void of lesser emotions like doubt. Never thought I’d read about a scheming revenge-bent accountant set of destroying her colonizers from the inside but Baru makes it look as snazzy as any leader or war general. The rest of the cast isn’t as developed or entertaining, the ones the characters in the second half even less so. Muire Lo and Tain Hu get the bulk of any development, often falling a touch short of becoming fully rounded out. Most of the focus was on Baru’s plans and getting the ball rolling. The claims about parts of the story reading like a history textbook are true, sadly. Fun if you’re into seeing how Baru’s economic revenge plays out or how Taranoke is colonized, a chore if political intrigue bores you. There is an unsettling lack of description, making it a bit difficult to tell the characters, or ethnicities introduced, apart. <br /><br />In all it is a solidly entertaining book with an emotional end, although not one that has made me want to read the rest of the series."

      "review": "well this was raw as FUCK. can safely say i did not see the ending coming at all. uh. lmao. DAMN<br /><br />this story about a lesbian machiavelli has one of the more fastidious and gripping portrayals of empire and rebellion i've seen in sf/f, with a plausibility owed to 1) dickinson's detailed worldbuilding and 2) its familiarity with our own world history, particularly the transatlantic trade — but it's uniquely reinvented enough to feel as though it belongs in a separate fantasy world. when reading fantasy, i tend to be bored by books heavy in economics, bureaucracy, battle tactics and the like because i just don't find it interesting to read about. political intrigue also tends to be low on my list of interests. with dickinson's skillsets as an author and baru's role as an accountant and tactician, there is quite a bit of all of that. this is politically dense in a way i usually don't care for, but it's written <i>very</i> well, and smartly enough that i fully bought into baru's savantry. i could dock this a star for parts of the reading experience that dragged (of which there were quite a few), but it just never stopped being VERY good."

      "review": "OK so I have soooo many thoughts about this book????<br /><br />First of all, I loved it. I love love loved it until like the last chapter of the novel, where they had the trope I hate above all others: <input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"spoiler__control\" aria-label=\"The following text has been marked spoiler. Toggle checkbox to reveal or hide.\" onchange=\"this.labels[0].setAttribute('aria-hidden', !this.checked);\" id=\"0ac6f666-ece0-48da-aa93-3bdf4e319fc6\" /><label aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"spoiler\" for=\"0ac6f666-ece0-48da-aa93-3bdf4e319fc6\">Bury Your Gays. Yes, I know only one gay died, but still. A gay died, which I did not appreciate. I don't care that tons of other characters died, I don't care that it made the story tragic, or furthered the philosophical points being discussed. I come to fantasy novels to escape from that sort of thing, and it didn't sit well with me that a male author killed off a lesbian. *shrug* Just didn't like it.</label><br /><br />That being said, this is an absolutely masterful political fantasy. It took me 5 days to read, not because of lack of interest, but because it was so intricate that I had to read slower so that I wouldn't miss any of the connections being made. Baru's world is so intricately built, covering vast areas and weaving together political threads across several different nations and many characters. The novel heavily criticizes and discusses the impacts of colonialism and imperialism, which was a wonderful topic to read about, since it is barely touched upon in your run of the mill fiction, let alone a high fantasy.<br /><br />Baru was an amazingly interesting character. Not only did I enjoy reading about a lesbian in a fantasy world, but she was so smart and powerful too. She's selfish and crafty and someone I was absolutely captivated by. I was amazed that the author managed to make an accountant/mathematician so interesting and dynamic, since that's not a role I'd typically expect to create action in a story.<br /><br />Honestly the two major reasons I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the afore-mentioned trope (which I really, really hated) and because the beginning was so slow for me. Even tho I loved learning about Baru's homeland, I felt like those chapters really dragged, and I literally was considering dnf-ing the book, since things didn't pick up til Baru left her homeland.<br /><br />Would I recommend it?? I think so, yes. I'd say it's worth the read, despite the bitter aftertaste left by the last chapter. I still really enjoyed this book."

      "review": "<i>\"Baru loved her mother and her fathers dearly, but she loved to know things just a small measure more, and she had recently discovered cunning.\"</i><br /><br /><br />This book started so GOOD. I was convinced, this was going to be a five star read, for sure.<br />Sadly, I got lost somewhere along the middle.<br /><br />Minor spoilers ahead! (about the first 100 pages)<br /><br />The world building which seemed so promising initially, soon dissolved into the typical fantasy setting. I'm aware that's caused by the nature of the plot and regime structure that is centre of that plot. But it felt disappointing nontheless to be teased with different and exciting cultures, only to see them crushed within the first few pages.<br /><br />The biggest problem for me, though, was something different. The writing was very disconnected from the characters. It was probably supposed to be 3rd person limited (maybe? not sure, pls don't hurt me), but we rarely get to experience Baru's real emotions. We see her acting and have to guess at her internal motivations, in order for the author to build and keep suspense.<br />In theory that may have worked, but in reality I felt very detached from Baru. The reader is spectator here, not living the story through the protagonist's eyes. It was similar to reading a history book about people nobody cared about. It caused me to never respect Baru's actions, because they seemed erratic at some times and cold hearted at others, and therefore I <b>wasn't interested in the ending</b>. <br /><br />Every twist left me cold, because I couldn't care one iota for anyone in this book. <br /><br />Also there were some pacing issues with the chapters 10 to 21, because, again, there was nothing to invest in.<br /><br />I loved the idea behind this novel.<b> Fantasy with focus on economy, instead of military politics. A lesbian accountant as heroine!</b> But I could not love the novel itself."

      "review": "I finished this book a couple weeks ago and it has taken me a while to really gather my thoughts on it. I’m not lying when I say I’ve thought about it almost every day since I finished reading. It’s one that really stays with you.<br /><br />First off, this book is pretty dense, kind of slow, and full of economics that I’m not going to pretend I understand. The overarching idea of Baru moving up in the Masquerade to tear it down after it has colonized her home, after it has told her that her family is wrong and she herself is wrong for being a lesbian, was the reason I picked it up and Baru’s development into a ruthless person who can actually get the power she seeks is incredible. <br /><br />I tagged for spoilers but just in case, they are below! <br /><br />I really liked the characters of Muire Lo, Unuxekome and Tain Hu, probably more than I like Baru. Especially Tain Hu. The slow burn between Tain Hu and Baru was really well done and the scene where they can finally admit what they are to each other made me so ecstatic. <br /><br />Now, the end. Specifically, the death of Tain Hu at Baru’s own orders. I have gone back and forth on this. Naturally, I was incredibly upset, because, well, it’s meant to be upsetting! My first instinct was that this was just another example of Bury Your Gays and lesbians never getting a happy ending. And it is those things, and I’d never begrudge anyone who didn’t want to read this book because of it. But Baru, The Traitor, is not searching for a happy ending in the form of romantic love. She loves her home, and she loves her family, and her one goal is to save them from the Masquerade. The rationale Baru has for her decision regarding Tain Hu makes sense for where Baru is at, it serves a larger narrative purpose, it informs her character development, and even if I’m upset, even if I think we probably need a bit of a moratorium on killing lgbt characters...I get it. I like tragedy in fiction, I like lgbt characters in fiction, and I like when these things intersect in certain ways. <br /><br />When I read the synopsis for this book, one of the reasons I decided to read it was because it reminds me of Black Sails. And my final thought on the matter of Tain Hu’s death can be summed up by one of my favorite quotes from the show: “It is some kind of hell to be forced to choose one irreplaceable thing over another.”"

      "review": "Hmm. HMM. <br /><br />Okay, here's a review: This book has a lot going for it. The writing is mostly very good, though I took issue with some characterization in the very first chapter that I mostly later forgot about. (How do children talk? Like emotionless academics, probably.) A few of the characters I thought were interestingly drawn, but there were so many characters that it felt like they got away from the author a bit. Duke who? Duchess what? And someone with red hair I guess? If someone else described the entire plot to me over drinks, I would probably love it, so the bones of it are captivating. And I really enjoyed that it dealt with colonialism and assimilation and economics (though if you're actually into economics you'll probably find it simplistic and obvious).<br /><br />I accidentally spoiled myself for this book, which I would argue is a better reading experience. <input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"spoiler__control\" aria-label=\"The following text has been marked spoiler.

But because I <i>knew</i> and didn't therefore experience any rug-pulling, I was able to enjoy that part of the book.<br /><br />Anyway, the things that most spoiled my enjoyment of this book: <br />* It's all about political machinations DANG IT stop making me read about fictional politicians, book club! There's not even any magic in this book! (Though there are hints at the end that in the second book there might be, which is mean and not good enough.)<br />* The middle. SORRY. It went on forever and the dukes were indistinguishable and it could've been half as long and I would've enjoyed it ten times as much. It wasn't bad, but it was long.<br />* Tragic lesbians.<br />* The map was terrible. Both graphically (barffff) and content-wise, because it was annotated, clearly by Baru, but at what point? When did she have this opinion about this duchy?? Also, the notes didn't really sound like her voice within the novel.<br />* It's not a standalone IT'S NOT A STANDALONE THERE'S GOING TO BE A SEQUEL. I was sold a false bill of goods.<br /><br />Anyway, a lot of people have really enjoyed this and I'm happy for them."

O_o<br /><br />Baru Cormorant remembers the day the Empire of Masks came to her island; she remembers how they rewrote her culture, criminalised her customs, and murdered of one of her fathers. But she is smart and she is patient. She goes to the Masquerade's school, studies their version of truth and nurtures her rage in silence. Baru has a plan: she will claw her way into power and take the Empire of Masks down from the inside.<br /><br />Sprawling political intrigue in a low-fantasy setting with a healthy sprinkling of dastardly plots, secret rebellions and all-out-war? Yep, that sounds like exactly my cup of tea. I did love large parts of this book, I thought it was well-written, and I was very, very invested emotionally. The sense of danger, urgency and secrecy was palpable throughout, even in the middle section which is all about accounting and finances.<br /><br />I had more of a problem with the ending: there's a twist in there that relies on the narration withholding crucial information from the reader. I wasn't convinced by Baru as an unreliable narrator, just felt like I was getting the rug pulled out from under my feet with no warning.<br /><br />Also, as many people have mentioned, there are some gruesome deaths of queer characters, but it's a pretty gruesome book all the way through."

      "review": "I finished late last night after a long day, so I needed time to think about it. <br />I liked auf good court intrigue and this book is full of plots and counter-plots.<br />I can't say I liked Baru, but it was fascinating to watching her and try to figure out what she was up to. <br /><br />I will put the rest under a tag, since it contains spoilers.<br /><br /><input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"spoiler__control\" aria-label=\"The following text has been marked spoiler. Toggle checkbox to reveal or hide.\" onchange=\"this.labels[0].setAttribute('aria-hidden', !this.checked);\" id=\"d64be804-3680-4d15-a05e-83f638270b91\" /><label aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"spoiler\" for=\"d64be804-3680-4d15-a05e-83f638270b91\">I was mostly drawn in by Baru's single-minded focus on somehow gaining enough power within the Masquerade to overthrow it or at least \"save\" Taranoke. Though it is also clear that she \"can't go home again\" and I'm not sure in how far she's allowed herself to realize that. There is a sad, nostalgic undertone to the story that touched me. (And reminded me of Robbin Hobb's books in a way.)<br />It was fascinating watching her going forward with the rebellion and the things she was willing to do to win. (Some of that should have been clues....) We're supposed to be rooting for her and at the same time, I think, we're supposed to be horrified by what she's willing to do and by how the imperial power structures work on her. Really, the final betrayal was and wasn't a surprise. <br /><br />Speaking of imperialism, I really liked how the book used a fantasy setting to explore the workings of empire and how people are made and make themselves into tools for \"the throne\", even if they want to overthrow it.<br />And some of these tools are eugenics/Incrasticism and homophobia. Again, I think the novel did a good job of exploring how these are used for conquest and domination. If I were to recommend this book to anyone, I would always slap on a huge content warning about this. Ultimately, the homophobia was not a dealbreaker for me because it was clearly depicted as wrong and destructive and something that is used to control populations, unlike in other fantasy series, where homophobia is included \"because it's based on European history and that's how people thought in xx century.\" This book is based in European history, too, but it doesn't take the easy way out in explaining why this is a thing, I think.<br />In addition, Baru isn't depicted as a traitor/evil because she's a queer woman. It, and the death of Father Salm, are clearly motivations for her, but they're motivations we understand. It's not the shorthand of evil = queer that has been used in other sf/f books. And we do see, to a certaun extent, what denying this part of herself does to her and that it's not good. The fact that most (all?) of the other queer characters die (and often gruesome deaths) did leave me with a bad taste in my mouth. </label>"

      "review": "Neat story! It's a \"hard fantasy\" (i.e. castles and swords, but no magic) novel about a woman from a small island nation that gets taken over by the \"Empire of Masks,\" a large colonial power that seeks to conquer and \"civilize\" the entire region. Baru, the protagonist, enlists with the Empire in an attempt to take them down from within.<br /><br />It's interesting because, while there is some of the usual fantasy conflict involving swordfights and arrows, most of the conflict is about navigating the Byzantine imperial bureaucracy, managing the financial system, and forming alliances. Baru herself is a complicated figure, with a series of conflicting loyalties and morally gray dilemmas.<br /><br />A few things could have been better. First, the Empire could have been a bit less evil. Part of what they're doing is modernizing the economy of their region, establishing schools, and bringing technology. Unfortunately, all the nuance is kind of swept away by their practice of killing or reconditioning anyone with any queer leanings. I think the author was trying to show that there was an upside to Imperial rule, but then undermined that by having them be unapologetic homophobes to the point of murder. <br /><br />I also had trouble following some of the more complicated parts of the book, both the webs of alliances and betrayals (though that may have just been lazy reading on my part), and the more complicated military clashes. I general, I just wanted the actions scenes to be over so I could get back to the interesting personal and political drama.<br /><br />Overall, it was very good! I'm looking forward to the sequel."

I loved the way the world building was conveyed through both dialogue as well as Baru’s analytical thought processes, it really helped the universe feel whole and lived in. The characters are dynamic and flawed in the best ways possible, and I couldn’t help being compelled by Baru’s intense descent. The final betrayal was perfectly laid out to keep you on your toes until the last second, while still feeling like it wasn’t a cheap “gotcha!” at the end. <br /><br />My main dislikes of the book are mostly personal preferences. The world Heavily falls under the trope of having homosexuality being a taboo in “civilized society”, and is extremely harsh with its depictions. I don’t think this is inherently a bad aspect of world building, but as a personal preference it does get exhausting to read books where the main queer obstacle is the same homophobia we face in reality.

In fact, I went into this book thinking it was SF, but I’m glad I kept at it. <p><br /><br />+ Deeply complex, conflicted characters. Baru reminds me of Breq from <a href=\"https://goodreads.com/book/show/17333324.Ancillary_Justice__Imperial_Radch___1_\" title=\"Ancillary Justice (Imperial Radch, #1) by Ann Leckie\" rel=\"noopener\">Ancillary Justice</a>, except less sure of herself, and less righteous. I can’t decide whether to love or hate Baru. I don’t think Baru herself can decide.<br /><br />+ Raises some very uncomfortable, complex thoughts about colonisation (cultural, economic, by force), what it means to colonise and be colonised, and all that comes with it. I live in a country which was colonised, and my people have been colonised and been the coloniser. We still live with the effects of that colonisation even today, for better or worse, so I’m having to process these thoughts while I’m reading this. My brain is <i>really</i> not used to holding such big, difficult thoughts.<br /><br />+/- The prose can be beautiful and lyrical, yet brutal and uncompromising. Sometimes it is more lyrical than clear, so there were a couple of times where I had to stop and re-read a sentence a few times to understand it. Especially in the final pages, it all gets very unclear and stylistic.</p><p><br /><br />- Baru is difficult to identify with; I was reading more to find out what happened next to her colourful allies, rather than her. She’s a bit too cold and distant to be relatable.<br /><br />- Baru is playing the long game, but the actual achievable end goal remains nebulous. Macro goals are good, but there needs to be a thing to be done.<br /><br />- Too many characters were introduced too fast; for most of the book I had difficulty keeping track.<br /><br />- The queer characters die in awful, painful ways. Sigh. </p><p><br /><br />In conclusion: One of the most difficult books I’ve ever read, and probably one of the best books I will never read again.</p>"

      "review": "There are some books I'd recommend to pretty much anyone who likes the relevant genre. Personally, I really liked this book, but before I go into the reasons why (as well as a few things I didn't like), it's worth making clear that there are some people who I don't think would enjoy this. <br /><br />Firstly, don't read this if you're not comfortable with LGBT and polyamorous characters. As my title makes clear, the heroine is gay, as are numerous other characters, and this is central to the plot. <br />Secondly, step away if you have little knowledge of or interest in basic issues of politics and economics. More than most fantasy novels, this one uses things like trade wars, deliberate devaluation of currency and forensic accounting to drive the plot forward - something which you might find fascinating and clever, or might find confusing and dull. <br />Thirdly, if you like happy endings or uncomplicated heroines, don't go anywhere near this. <br /><br />Luckily, I like a bit of diversity, I'm interested in politics, and I love anti-hero(ines), villain protagonists and dark plots. And as a civil servant myself, I enjoyed reading something with such an unusual choice of protagonist. <br /><br />On the political side, there was lots of debate about the rights and wrongs of empires that take away colonists' culture but give them medicine and wealth, and about the morality of doing bad things for good purposes. It was pretty clear that the author had a broadly liberal bent, but this still felt like an interesting discussion, not a polemic. <br /><br />Overall therefore, I found this an unusual and enjoyable read that engaged both my imagination and my brain. On the negative side, I didn't hugely engage with any of the characters or feel super-invested in the outcomes, and though it was enjoyably slowburn in places, in others, it felt a bit too stretched out. I also guessed the key twist at a relatively early stage. <br /><br />If this sounds like something that would appeal to you at all, I'd highly recommend that you give it a try. I suspect it's one of those books people will love or hate. I was definitely closer to the former category and would definitely read any sequel, though that doesn't mean I found it a perfect read. <br />"

      "review": "<b>You are the one who brings everything that you see in this book. For good, or for bad.</b><br /><br />This is more than a book. This is a litmus test of a book that is a laughably simple trap to weed out conservatives seeking their \"safe spaces\". The beauty here is that this book doesn't actually say the things you 'think it is saying'. It is your personal experience that fills in the spaces in this book. It's your own prejudice, how (and where or when) you were raised, and what political views you have at the moment.<br /><br />The big 'thing' in this book is a plot point which is sure to raise the hackles of our alt-right crusading reviewers—there is some *gasp* gay stuff being mentioned ... I know, I know ... the horror ...<br /><br />BUT <br /><br />... here is the kicker; \"We never really know if the characters are even human\". this book specifically never mentions body parts other than hair or muscles and it even discusses a race (Lamen) that has to use makeup to 'choose' a gender so as not to confuse the 'binary races'. This could only have been purposeful, as even during one scene drinking in a brothel, there is an extremely vague reference to sex without 'specifically' discussing any body parts. Sexual orientation is never an actual real concrete point in the story other than as a 'thought crime'. It's simply there to show the absolute power and terror of Empire and colonization methods. <br /><br />This book NEVER—not once—makes a value judgement about the core topics at hand. All value judgements you see in this book are yours. The book shows the maze of Empire and colonization without any comment, except for Baru, who starts (and ends) the story wanting to destroy it from within because she doesn't want others to have their homes and cultures destroyed (without saying it is 'bad'). I actually went back through various points in the book where I 'thought' a value judgement was being positioned in the story and in every instance I found it was me, the reader, who made the judgement. <br /><br /><i>If you are curious about the critical reviews, look no further than the political division in the USA. Look at the other reviews by the critical ones here and you will notice how seemingly all their reviews for books are a mission to 'fight' against any literature where sex is not absolutely binary and the main character is not a strapping male killing aliens or shooting the bad guys. They use phrases like \"Just not for me...\" and \"I couldn't get into it...\" while clearly being weeded out in the first chapter.</i><br /><br />This is a fascinating piece of literature which explores important themes of colonization and control. It's a pretty amazing think-piece as well because you enter the plot and your judgements clarify the way forward in the book based on how you think about the things presented. You are going to have very different response to nearly every point in the book if you see a topic one way as a person who sees that topic another and you will be the one to fill in between the paragraphs with your views.<br /><br />Anyway, well worth the read. This volume could stand on it's own, easy. I hope the follow-up books continue to follow in this vein."

      "review": "This is my best friend's favorite book of maybe all time and I wanted to like it, but I didn't. I know I'm in the minority among my friends who generally seemed to enjoy it, so maybe you will too. But I found this one of the most depressing books I've ever read.<br /><br />I vaguely remembered getting some hints about the book's ending in a conversation years back; no real spoilers, but they may have colored my reading of this book either way. One thing that made this book hard for me to get through is the fact that I couldn't really get a measure of any of the characters. I didn't understand the motivations behind their actions, not even Baru's, and maybe that's supposed to add to the whole political-intrigue vibe, but it just made it hard for me to root for any character. <br /><br />It doesn't help that most descriptions of the setting, the character's lives, and the all-powerful evil empire are so depressing. I could sort of appreciate how the evil empire is portrayed in a way that does truly make you hate it. But finding out more about this intense world the author built was not really enjoyable, since everything was so bad; the empire is oppressive and discriminatory and all-powerful, and thinks slavery is just fine if the slaves like it, but life without the empire is all scurvy and hunger and destitution. Nobody wins either way.<br /><br />I could also appreciate the aspect of the book that takes the power of money into account, it's a take I don't see very often. However, when it came time to have actual action scenes in the book, their descriptions were vague and required several read-throughs for me to understand what actually happened. <br /><br />Then, of course, there's the ending. Now, I'm an optimistic person, and I wanted to root for Baru, but I never could, because I never understood why she took certain actions. I saw two reasons for this; one was basically that the author implied Baru knew more than the readers (which I would think is bad writing), or the other being that the author was purposefully vague, so the finale could get extra shock value. I don't think that's a much better option. <input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"spoiler__control\" aria-label=\"The following text has been marked spoiler. Toggle checkbox to reveal or hide.\" onchange=\"this.labels[0].setAttribute('aria-hidden', !this.checked);\" id=\"9433dceb-08eb-49af-bf9f-943603e19319\" /><label aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"spoiler\" for=\"9433dceb-08eb-49af-bf9f-943603e19319\"> When Baru finally decides, at the end of the book, to live in the moment and chase her own happiness, if just for a second, I rooted for her, even knowing that it was too good to last. Then, of the two options for the terrible ending I knew was coming, I think it's not unsurprising that the author went for Baru betraying the rebels, instead of the other way around. Shock value, however, does not make a good book make. </label> The way the ending hurt me means I must have felt some goodwill towards some of the characters despite my lack of true sympathy. <br /><br />And in the end it just left me feeling so empty. Why did I read this book? I know that stories with sad/shocking/tragic endings can teach us about hope, and love. Life isn't forever, so you better enjoy the time you have. None of that was reflected in this book; at least not in my reading of it. Once I finish this review, I will enjoy my life - by never having to read or think about this book again."

If you want power in this world, power enough to change it, it seems you have to be.”</blockquote>\n</i><br /><br /><b>The Traitor Baru Cormorant</b> is, to put it simply—the story of a Sith apprentice's rise to power if you took out the space opera trappings and any musing of the Force, only to replace them with a vaguely historical setting, along with musings on the nature of colonialism and the terrible price it exacts.<br /><br />Baru Cormorant's story begins on her island home of Taranoke, which in short succession is approached by the Masquerade—who rule from distant Falcrest—and subjugated through the weapons of trade and epidemics, then culturally molded into the Falcresti ideal, one that erases the queernormativity of Taranoke in favor of eugenics via arranged marriages to 'breed' for ideal strengths and purge 'weaknesses' in an ethnic group.<br /><br />Believing that the the only way to salvage the freedom of her home is to work her way up into a position of power, Baru—under the patronage of enigmatic Falcresti merchant Cairdine Farrier—enrolls in the Masquerade's academy, against her parents' desires. Fast forward some years, and her talents land her the position of Imperial Accountant in Aurdwynn. Her job: Sniff out threats to the Masquerade, in a land where sedition and rebellion run in every citizen's blood.<br /><br />Do this, and she has a shot at gaining the power to save Taranoke. Or will she?<br /><br /><i>\n  <blockquote>“It's not what the Masquerade does to you that you should you fear, she wanted to tell Ake. It's what the Masquerade convinces you to do to yourself.”</blockquote>\n</i><br /><br />Baru's political navigation in Aurdwynn is a major focus of the novel, and it thoroughly shows how she views the world; everything comes down to coin and economics. It is through these lens that she attempts to find dissenters, and the resulting tension is fun to watch, in a 'I never knew economics could be absolute popcorn drama fuel' sort of way.<br /><br />Entertainment aside, it also confronts the newly-minted Imperial Accountant with the following dilemmas: Is working within a oppressive regime to free one's home just, even if it means oppressing another's in the process? Do things like inoculation, a proper sewage system and an academic system of learning justify the means through which they came? <br /><br />The answers aren't forthright, at least in Baru's mind, and this underlines a brilliance of the novel as a whole; Baru is an <i>unreliable narrator</i> who has been shaped so much by the Masquerade that even her thoughts echo their doctrine. I'll return to this in a moment. <br /><br /><i>\n  <blockquote>“Your error is fundamental to the human psyche: you have allowed yourself to believe that others are mechanisms, static and solvable, whereas you are an agent.”</blockquote>\n</i><br /><br />But Baru is not the sole player in the great game of Aurdwynn. Arrayed against her are the other technocrats of the Masquerade and Aurdwynn's ducal powers, such as the Jurispotence Xate Yawa, the Duchess Tain Hu and the Phantom Duke, Xate Olake. <br /><br />It's established early into the book that one of Baru's greatest character flaws is the inability to acknowledge or recognize other political players as fellow players instead of just chess pieces. This is something I highly appreciate; it's in part, a deconstruction of the 'chosen one' who's gifted, where the narrative revolves around their actions. While Baru is very much the protagonist of this story, the author takes great care to remind the reader that she is but one perspective, and outside of it, she can be surprised, counterplayed, even beaten. It adds a level of narrative tension, and further hammers home that everything we see is interpreted through Baru's worldview (remember how to her, everything returns to economics?).<br /><br />Back to Baru's being an unreliable narrator; I genuinely feel that this is perhaps the best aspect of the novel. I'd like to touch on something personal here. Like Baru, my nation has been colonized, and by at least four sovereign powers (the Portuguese, the Dutch, the British and the Japanese). Unlike Taranoke, my home is now free, but it remains marked by those legacies. I speak and think in English better than I do my mother tongue. Our national language has loan words passed down from those colonial eras. Our education system, our laws (including that against gay marriage), even our names, are marked by our British oppressors. We may no longer be under their rule, but the consequences of it linger to this very day. It has, on more than one occasion, made me wonder how much of my thoughts and ideals are my own, and how much of it are derived from foreign shores.<br /><br />I think that Baru herself faces a similar situation, albeit more extreme. While she seeks her home's freedom, she has been conditioned to believe that <i>only</i> the ideas of the Masquerade can win the game she seeks to play. In following, her weapons are Falcrest's weapons. Her solutions, their solutions. It raises the question: Is Baru an agent of Taranoki liberation, or a new means of Falcrest's subjugation? Can anyone wield the tools of imperialism without advancing its cause in turn?<br /><br />I'm going to stop before I fall into a keyboard-mashing ramble full of word vomit that spells 'BOOK VERY GOOD,' but to conclude, <i>The Traitor Baru Cormorant</i> is a story that grapples with an experience all too real and all too lived (to me, at least). It's an examination of the cost one must pay for the power to change the world, and how that warps those who seek it in turn. It's a book that, two years after I first read it, still lingers in my mind. If there's any one SF/F book I would ask anyone to read, this would be my unhesitating pick."

The themes were nitty-gritty dirty and I loved them. This book excelled on many levels. I wish it was a little faster paced. It got a little long-winded at some points and became tedious.

      "review": "Objectively speaking, this was an <b>original and fresh political fantasy.</b> It was unique seeing revolution not from the perspective of warriors and generals, but from the perspective of a <b>cunning, morally grey savant protagonist</b> who strategizes with alliances and betrayals, and who plays games orchestrating resources and the economy—the underlying forces that, very often, <i>actually</i> determine a war. <br /><br />Subjectively speaking, though, <b>this wasn't to my taste.</b> I do prefer adventurous fantasy over political fantasy. And while the twist at the end will shock and satisfy certain kinds of readers, it just left me feeling disappointed. By the time Baru revealed herself to be quite a monster, I disconnected with her. I was surprised by the ending, but not in a good way. <br /><br />Also, <b>SPOILER</b>, I'm really tired of <b>sapphic plots</b> that are all angsty and indecisive and ultimately <b>end in tragedy.</b> There's nothing at all wrong with writing them; the author had perfectly good storytelling reasons to do so here. <br /><br />But as a sapphic woman myself, who seems to encounter such narratives for f/f relationships far more often than ones that are healthy, end at least somewhat happily, etc., <b>I'm just exhausted. I don't want to read them anymore.</b><br /><br />My personal opinions aside, this technically was a very well-written book, and to the right reader it will be a helluva treat: I just wasn't that reader. <br /><br />(<b>An aside:</b> This is an example of the rich speculative fiction literature coming out of ADULT these days, for those who are tired of the drama of YA! I imagine the YA Twitter mobs would have tried to tear this book to shreds if it were YA, haha, because it's not politically correct or \"sensitive\", but that's actually why I think this is technically great literature: It takes risks, pulls no punches, and explores the dark and the gray with frank fearlessness. As a result, it will turn some people off, i.e., me. All great literature should be turning <i>someone</i> off, or else it's too safe and shallow to do society any good.)"

      "review": "Who could resist the premise \"genius lesbian uses intrigue and math to save her polyamourous homeland from an evil colonial empire\"?<br /><br />Given such a unique pitch, I was surprised how strikingly similar the first 140 pages of <i>The Traitor Baru Cormorant</i> were to Arkady Martine's <i>A Memory Called Empire</i>[1]: smart gay woman from a close-knit far-flung community is appointed to a powerful government position in the empire after the mysterious murder of her predecessor, alone but for a clever aide to help her figure out both the foreign culture and the ongoing political machinations.<br /><br />Unfortunately for Traitor Baru, the contrast with <i>A Memory Called Empire </i>serves only to highlight its flaws. The empire of Baru's world conquers the world, exterminating gay people, enforcing an extensive eugenics breeding program, and improving record-keeping as it gobbles up cultures. It is very clearly capital E Evil, and nearly every citizen of the empire that we meet is either a political puppetmaster or a puppet. A Memory Called Empire's Mahit finds herself trying to protect her people from the Teixcalaan empire while also loving parts of the empire: its people, its culture, its literature. This contrast adds tension, but also presents a more relatable empire. The biggest empire of the 21st century is an oppressive colonial power with some wonderful people and a great canon, including notable works like Casa Blanca and Bojack Horseman.<br /><br />The flat world-building extends also to Aurdwynn, the province brimming with rebellion to which Baru is assigned as Imperial Accountant. There are hints at interesting designs—the druidic Ilykari, or the Unsullied-like Clarified, for example—but it felt like all the scenes characterizing the minor characters (excepting, perhaps, Muire Lo, Tain Hu, and Xate Olake) and describing the Aurdwynni culture and history were cropped to keep the novel to a tidy 399 pages. Aurdwynn could be any fantasy country. The dukes could be fully summarized with a tagline and never developed personality beyond that: \"the philosophical one\", \"the sailor one\", \"the one that collects handsome baby daddies.\" The result is a story packed with political intrigue and twists where I don't care about any of the players, nor do I really care about the fate of the country. The exception to this is the slow burn relationship between Baru and Duchess Tain Hu; the two have great chemistry and their scenes together are adorable. But because such long swathes of the book were low emotional impact, the book was somehow too long for it to be a tight story of a savant accountant trying to out-maneuver seasoned politicians to save her home, and too short for a compelling narrative about how economics and the personalities of political leaders shape the course of a revolution.<br /><br />Baru was an enjoyable protagonist. Her weapons of war are unconventional and its fun to watch her wield them: controlling inflation to stop a rebellion, using annual tax forms to discern loyalties, identifying political ambitions through sales of commodity goods. She's very aware of the importance of keeping up her metaphorical (and sometimes literal) mask: she must project power and the right sort of ambitions, and she must hide her sexual orientation and her loyalty to Taranoke. The first person point of view gives us an intimate perspective from which to watch her calculations about which facial expressions to make, or what information to reveal when, and see her react to realizing when she's made mistakes and let her mask slip, or developed more attachment to people and places than she had intended. Still, this intimate perspective is inconsistently applied—we know she has made a deal with the shadow cabinet behind the imperial throne, but not what it is. This separation between Baru and the reader seems (to me, at least) intended to allow for a plot twist, rather than say anything about the nature of the mask between Baru and the reader. I think this would have been more effective if Baru was aware of the reader, taunting us a little with her unreliable narrator perspective.<br /><br />The end of this book, the first of a planned trilogy, is dark and bleak. The Falcrest empire asks Baru to foment a rebellion then betray it. The Empire crushes the hope of the Aurdwynni people for generations to come, and Baru gets the approval of the Empire and the power that comes with it. This is the way the Empire operates: convince people there is no point in rebelling:<br /><br /><blockquote>In Falcrest, in the Metademe, they condition prisoners just so: permit escape. Offer a rescuer, a collaborator. Slip a key in with the food. Let them come close to freedom, let them feel real triumph—they would not let me this far! This is the crux: give them the taste of victory, the certainty that this cannot be part of the game. And then snatch it away. The collaborator betrays them. The key will not open the outermost door. With enough repetition, most prisoners learn to ignore a key, an open door, a whisper to run. Led out onto the street, they will wait to be returned to their cells. After a time, they begin to teach new prisoners the same.</blockquote><br /><br />Her rebellion, the one to save her home country of Taranoke, will be different, Baru tells herself. The costs to the Aurdwynn people are worth it—and actually this brief, squashed Aurdwynni rebellion saves Aurdwynni lives in the long run.<br /><br />Still, I am interested in where the author will take this theme over the course of the next books. Perhaps the mathematical and rational to a fault Baru will need to inspire hope in her people, inspire belief that there is a better solution and that it is possible to get there. How does one go about this? What is the answer to \"well, there's no such thing as ethical consumption under capitalism, so I just live my life and don't think too hard about it\"?<br /><br />[1] Review here: <a href=\"https://www.itsallgeekto.me/2021/06/review-memory-called-empire-arkady-martine-culture-language-history.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://www.itsallgeekto.me/2021/06/review-memory-called-empire-arkady-martine-culture-language-history.html</a>"

The book has what I've heard some call a brutal ending; this is certainly true. I managed to see some of it coming, which helped blunt some of that, but overall the ending is great.<br /><br />2. The author is really good at foreshadowing for someone who was only 26 when the book was published. I look forward to his later works.<br /><br />3. There is little to no magic in this world. In some sense, this is just a story set during the expansion of a weird but twisted Empire in a constructed world - the fantastical elements, though they exist, are pretty muted in this book. <br /><br />4. I adored the main character of the book, but I'm not sure how I feel about the fact that she's a non-practicing lesbian, but I guess it's not like the author portrays that positively; it's just another way in which the Empire she works for oppresses her identity.<br /><br />5. I was surprisingly invested in the main romantic thread of the book, given how little time was actually devoted to it, and how it ended (and, I suppose, given that it wasn't hetero-normative).<br /><br />6. The intrigue was overall really good, and there was some solid background economics working in this book - the plot is more about that than about battles or wars, which is quite refreshing.<br /><br />Overall, I'd recommend it to anyone who likes fantasy, or to someone who might want to see economics in a fantasy book."

I love the protagonist, I love that she is so ambitious with her one-track mind; it ends up hurting people that she loves but she is so laser-focused and committed to her goal in the long run that she would do it again if she had to. And so I really appreciate that about her character.<br /><br />It still is a slog at some parts, I will admit. This book took me the longest to read in 2022--not that I've read a lot of books that year for that statistic to be significant, but I digress. It is a <i>long</i> book.

      "review": "I'm going to preface this review with something that I wish had been mentioned in the breathless reviews of this book: It is a very serious, demoralizing tragedy with no hope at the end. In this book, women suffer, queer people suffer, and BIPOC characters suffer precisely because they hold these various marginalized identities — and characters who sit at the intersections of these identities suffer the most of all, including both torture and death. If you find that triggering to read, then I would avoid this book at all costs. If, however, you find it cathartic to find the grim realities of the world reproduced in an epic fantasy setting, then you are probably exactly the target audience for this book.<br /><br />I was actually lukewarm on this book until the final chapter, which pushes it from a 3.5 star read into 2 star territory for me. There are certainly some redeeming aspects to this book, which made it an all-the-more frustrating read. For one, it features fresh world-building that incorporates a lot from non-western cultures. Admittedly, it feel less fresh now that it probably would have when it was originally published in 2015, given all the wonderful non-western fantasies that have been published since then, many by BIPOC who actually hails from the countries and cultures their lands are based on.<br /><br />This book also explores at empire and oppressor through the lens of the oppressed, which is unusual, as most epic military fantasy takes the POV of empire, or perhaps several different empires vying for power. Another unique element is the inclusion of economics, accounting, and finance as important mechanisms in how nations garner power (though I had some caveats, see below). The prose is also high quality, and some of the fight scenes had me on the edge of my seat.<br /><br />However, these positive qualities could not outweigh the negatives for me. The first 1/3 of the book is horrifically slow, and it also drags a bit in the middle and gets caught up in the tactical choices of the rebellion. I was shocked to see that is book is only 400 pages long, because it felt more like 800 pages as I was reading — and I'm a fast reader. The pacing is also slowed by the metric ton of made up names and terminology on every single page. I know a lot of hard epic fantasies do this, but boy is hard to keep up with.<br /><br />I was also annoyed about how the success of Baru's inflation gambit depends on the total ignorance of ALL the dukes about an economics 101 concept. It seemed unrealistic at best and lazy writing at worst. In addition, Falcrest is presented as so uniformly terrible that it's hard to see why anyone would want to live in at all, rather than burn it down. (And, no, a \"science and infrastructure\" handwave excuse is not enough to convince me, most especially not after 2020.)<br /><br />Unfortunately, these drawbacks pale in comparison at the ending, in which it is revealed that Baru has been working for <input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"spoiler__control\" aria-label=\"The following text has been marked spoiler. Toggle checkbox to reveal or hide.\" onchange=\"this.labels[0].setAttribute('aria-hidden', !this.checked);\" id=\"86bd821e-63b9-4483-842d-4616bde8662c\" /><label aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"spoiler\" for=\"86bd821e-63b9-4483-842d-4616bde8662c\">Falcrest</label> the entire time, and the rebellion is only a strategy to <input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"spoiler__control\" aria-label=\"The following text has been marked spoiler.

Baru only agonizes over the decision briefly, and by then it is too late for her to undo the mechanisms that she has secretly set in place throughout the entire book, unbeknownst to the reader. Not only is this choice a narrative bait-and-switch, it also robs readers of the chance to see Baru wrestle with this decision. I could not help but compare this book to the Machineries of Empire and The Poppy War, two other epic SFF series that feature women of color wrestling with the decision to destroy one people to save another — but in those series, we see the characters struggle rather than being surprised at the very end. Even if the outcome didn't change, I wanted to see how Baru's mind worked and how she justified her decisions to herself. I don't need to like protagonists, but I do want to know what makes them tick, and that is absent from this book.<br /><br />As a result of this, Baru exhibits no real character growth during the book, and always holds readers at a great distance. This is a bit problematic, given that she is the only main character, plus the only two other characters readers are make to like eventually die horrible deaths because of Baru's actions. <input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"spoiler__control\" aria-label=\"The following text has been marked spoiler.

If she'd died in battle, that would still be bad, but having her drowned at the very end was just horrible. It's like the ultimate manifestation of burying your gays.</label> If I've read 400 pages and still don't know the main character — in fact, cannot know the main character due to the way the book is set up — then I personally see no point in continuing with the series."

I’ve been forceably marched through Baru’s childhood at whipneck speed where she speaks like a gifted child calculator with only an interest in economics, not at all like a real child. I don’t know who these readers who bemoan the horror of the first two chapters at all, the suffering and deaths of Baru’s people is ultimately rendered meaningless by how flat and utterly lifeless they read. They’re just paper dolls that blew away in the wind: none of their suffering or emotions reach me as reader, in fact Baru’s parents only express annoyance at dealing with Baru’s economic spiels, as most of their dialogue consists of telling her to go do something, be quiet, or remember her dead dad. <br /><br />And like, okay, the homophobia is just there for there as a prop to show how evil the Masquerade is. I have yet to get a cultural explanation as to way they might feel that it’s evil, it’s just very generic and doesn’t really tie into more nunaced, historically grounded socio-cultural constructs of homosexuality, homosociality, or homophobia, it’s just this morality anvil that doesn’t do much but blungeon the reader over the head with how bad the Falcrest are. And I would definitely say that it suffers from bury your gays in spades, except the gay characters are so lifeless and bland that their deaths don’t affect me as a queer reader; I feel no connection to them as their trauma is never experienced in any length on the page, nor does the bland ass robot protagonist have any deep, organic emotional reaction to them.<br /><br />There’s also a lack of cultural consistency displayed in the setting that just irks me. A whole number of crops are mentioned in the market scenes in the early chapters having been grown in the same region, but no description is given of the terrain of Baru’s homeland other than it’s volcanic, and I can tell you some of those crops would not grow there at all. Also the whole ballroom sequence is so lazy and doesn’t seem like it would be in the style at all of the bickering Northern dukes.<br /><br />I don’t know how to end this, being the first book review I’ve done in years, but this book just drives me mad with how poorly paced it is and the badly conceived worldbuilding.Would not recommend, unless you feel like suffering through it for free from a library. But spend your time reading better."

I liked the themes of conquest through culture. I did not like the twist ending and I definitely did not like all the queer peril. <br /><br />Let's start with the queer peril. Baru's motivation is that one of her two fathers is killed by the Evil Empire. Baru herself is queer and we are reminded over and over of the horrible fate queer people suffer under the Evil Empire. <input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"spoiler__control\" aria-label=\"The following text has been marked spoiler.

It's just unrelenting peril and grief, and there is very little joy or queer resistance. And I just do not like reading about the unending suffering of queer people. <br /><br />I read another review about the POV and I agree with that. The book starts and ends with a close third POV where we as readers have access to Baru's thoughts and feelings. The middle of the book takes a big step back and gives us limited third, with very little insight into Baru's thoughts and feelings. The moments when Baru has thoughts feel almost as jarring as a television character breaking the fourth wall. Because the whole middle is a bunch of hard to pronounce names doing scheming things, I really needed that anchor of Baru's inner self to help me make sense of this and feel anything about the events. I assume this distancing was intentional to pull off the twist at the end, but I felt extremely frustrated and confused. <input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"spoiler__control\" aria-label=\"The following text has been marked spoiler.

I'll be honest, the first chapter or two did not grab me and I wondered if I'd be able to get through it. But it quickly gets much more interesting and the depth of the story comes in quite quickly. This is a book you MUST take your time with, otherwise you not only will understand absolutely nothing of what is going on, but you won't be able to sit with all the moral and philosophical questions and reckonings this book asks of you. It is a lot. It not a light read. It is brutal, depressing, and nothing good happens, honestly. But I couldn't stop reading; I just became engrossed in the plot, the characters, the world. I needed to know what would happen. I'll admit it was hard to follow sometimes and hard to keep track of all the amounts of constant information and intrigue and connections and names and what have you - I felt genuinely dumb more than once as I read through, thoroughly glad that I am not and will never be in any position to ever have to any kind of serious politicking. This book will be especially hard to read if you are queer, so use caution. But it also is one of those books I think does a very good job of bringing you deep into the world and making you a part of it (without any torture porn) to the point where you can see why homophobia, colonialism, etc. are terrible. And you have to watch characters constantly get chewed up and spat out by these systems, and it. is. hard. <br /><br />It is going to sit with me for a long time. I almost want to re-read it because I know there's so much more I could get out of it, but I don't think I can take it."

      "review": "I'm giving up. I have no interest in finishing this book, and I'm only maybe 30 pages from the end. There's a lot to like here - the world building is great, and I love how the book tackles colonialism, racism, homophobia, and I'm interested in how it explores economics as a tool of colonialism and explicitly recognizes that economic systems are capable of violence. There's a lot of very cool stuff going on here.<br /><br />But I was not able to emotionally connect to any of the characters, which is a big thing for me when reading. I also really wish that I had done some background reading on this book in advance because while there are several LGBTQIA+ characters in the book they face constant, graphic threats of physical violence, including genital mutilation. These threats are used as corrective action. Multiple queer characters are killed. <br /><br />Every time I thought \"I really should go finish Baru Cormorant\" I found myself picking up The Goblin Emperor or The Long Way to a Small Angry Planet and reading that instead for the nth time."

This was the first book that made me think that accountancy was interesting. This was a book that made me think so hard about so many things that I probably should have thought about before, but gave me such a plot that I didn't realise that I was thinking about them until it was too late and my ways of thought had been changed forever.<br /><br />I love this book with all my heart. I love how passionate it is, how queer it is, how much like a stiletto to the heart it feels. This book made me think, made me feel, made me love, made me hate, and I've been trying to get it to do the same to every one of my friends ever since."

I was invested in the romance, and while I'm not sure I'll get around to the sequel, it did scratch that little Cat Foundling/ Harrowhark itch. I was obviously invested in the romance more than anything.. the end was JUICY. I'm rooting for her! Not to have an obligatory wlw mention but I do love to see it within good plots among the garbage ones (Priory of the Orange Tree I will remain a hater).<br /><br />At the end, there was an expert from the third book, and I didn't know it was the third book so I just thought it was a time skip for the sequel 😭 BRUH lowkey pissed off like why did they do datt.

      "review": "Become what you hate to save what you love.<br /><br />In this tragic tale, the savant Baru vows to destroy the empire that's subsuming her homeland. The empire controls through brilliant economic policy, and it's vile through ridiculous social strategy. It suppresses alternate religions and sexuality. Baru's three-parent family is broken to pieces, and she lives in terror they will find out she desires women.<br /><br />Readers searching for diverse books would do well to consider The Traitor Baru Cormorant. Not only are different sexual orientations represented, but the protagonist is an islander. I interpreted this (and other elements of the setting) to mean she is non-Caucasian, despite how her face may appear on the cover.<br /><br />This book follows the tradition of epic fantasy series of being long on pages and short on progress toward the eventual goal. Given the length, I had hoped for a poignant conclusion. Instead we have but a brutal first step. Readers will have to decide for themselves if the pace is sufficient.<br /><br />At heart, this is book about economic policy, with the protagonist trying to wrench herself as much influence as fast as possible. The empire is a looming threat, but a nebulous one. Without a distinct antagonist to counter her moves, Baru tends to get her way. She has to swim through fear, but the current wends with her. Without robust opposition, her intellect is never much challenged as she executes her schemes.<br /><br />She wants to avenge herself against the empire, though not with violence. She understands other methods will be more powerful. I have been wishing for epic stories that don't rely on epic bloodbaths. For a nonviolent plot to work, it still must scream with tension and impress the reader with daring. The Traitor Baru Cormorant failed me in that regard, but other readers, it may satisfy."

I knew it would be good because I’ve enjoyed everything I’ve read that Amal El-Mohtar reviews/recommends, but I absolutely did not anticipate the depth this book contains. <br /><br />I love a flawed, multifaceted protagonist, and Baru epitomizes that. Through her struggles to free her country from imperial rule, the novel forces one to examine the reaches of righteousness, if the ends ever justify the means, even if one is in service of what one believes to be honorable and just. The author reminds me a bit of McEwan in that just as he is leading one to a conclusion, he destroys the foundation and presents alternate ideas, leading to uncomfortable, yet necessary, thinking as to what is most just, what is most forgivable, how ambition can twist to present a mirror of what one is fighting against.<br /><br />There is so much more: riveting economic strategies (something I never thought I’d write), unforgettable and complex supporting characters, the reaches of colonialism, love and sacrifice, and examinations of race, sexuality, and gender roles. It never stopped surprising me."

      "review": "The Traitor Baru Comorant<br /><br />Another debut novel that has been highly praised and seems to be quite divisive in reviews. This is a geo-political fantasy novel. Drawn from numerous real life situations, this novel explores colonialism- Empire of Masks conquers all the other island states and drives out the indigenous culture through education and policing ; gender and sexuality - very nuanced look at female leadership even with the clash with male expectations; religion - cults versus worship of the Emperor. This is all set on the background of political intrigue. It is quite a heady task for any author and so easy to botch. The author has been hailed as successful. I found this reading experience quite mixed. Whilst I can appreciated the authorial intent, there was a distance between the reader and the events being written. This is likely a reflection of the decision to narrate the story from Baru's POV. She inherently has to hold back information given the events. The reader can only experience the fallout as events unfold or be astute enough to sense what the author is doing. There are quite a few surprises near the end that made me look at the title and smile. Because there is a long game being promised but the cost seems quite high. <br /><br /><br /><br />"

      "review": "I really, really want to read this. <br /><br />Read an excerpt in a magazine (The Traitor Baru Cormorant, Her Field-General, and Their Wounds), and dang. Ruthless main character. The bit of hemiagnosia was extremely intriguing. <br /><br />Looking forward to September. Here's to hoping that a great short story writer can translate to an entire novel.<br /><br />---<br /><br />The hype is real. And the book actually withstood the hype as well. It was a book well worth the wait. <br /><br />The Empire of Masks has overcome Baru Cormorant's home country. Taken away her culture, her language, her identity, her religion, her sexuality, her parents. But she has always been an intelligent child, and she is willing to wait however long it takes to take down the Empire of Masks from the inside. And to do that, she must work within the Masquerade in a city on the brink of civil war. There are hidden costs to everything, and secrets that should never pass your lips.<br /><br />I love a good political fantasy - especially when the intricate, deadly plots are done in a clever manner. And my gosh, this book fits the bill. I adored most everything about this book. The plot is strong, cohesive, and consistently moves along without fail. The book put in some sociopolitical issues, but it never felt like it was forcing its opinions down my throat.<br /><br />I did have issues with character development, to be honest. There was simply not enough moments for me to believe that characters ended up having certain feelings (love, hate, trust, etc). I think this comes from Baru playing her cards so close to her chest - but it also means that we don't get a good sense of her feelings, much less the lesser characters. Did I believe that the main couple actually loved each other and would result in complete trust? No. There is no evidence previously to their declaration that they harbored such feelings. <br /><br />The ending. It's weird because I had already read the ending in the excerpt released before. But when you add the context of the entire book, the ending is that much more powerful. <br /><br />4.5 stars rounded down. Highly, highly recommended for fantasy fans."

      "review": "The Traitor Baru Cormorant tells the first chapter of a story about identity and betrayal, with a protagonist that is willing to do anything to change the system from within: it’s a fantasy novel concerned with political change, and the sacrifices necessary to propel it.<br /><br />The story starts when Baru is a little girl on the island of Taranoke, living with her two fathers and her mother Pinion. One day, Taranoke is visited by the Masquerade Empire, which proclaims to have come in peace, offering progress instead of war. But Baru quickly learns that dominion can occur without violence, as the subjective progress came with political and social control attached. Vowing to avenge Taranoke, Baru concocts a plan: she is to pretend to be faithful to the Empire and rise within its ranks until she has amassed enough power to topple it from within.<br /><br />The beginning of the novel focuses on the ways the Empire shackles Taranoke, disguising its power as benevolence: how it introduces paper currency to create debt, how it builds schools to indoctrinate its ideology, how it kills with disease and sells medicine for profit. Baru’s time in the new school, when she is still mesmerized by the comforts of the Empire, is described as such:<br /><br />“She went into the school, with her own uniform and her own bed in the crowded dormitory, and there in her first class on Scientific Society and Incrasticism she learned the words sodomite and tribadist and social crime and sanitary inheritance, and even the mantra of rule: order is preferable to disorder.”<br /><br />When Baru realizes what’s happening, it’s already too late, for the Empire has already got complete control over Taranoke. One of her fathers has been taken to be “corrected”, and even her mother, once a proud and fearsome warrior, is now reduced to her hurt: “Baru looked at her mother, at Pinion’s eyes red with fatigue, her shoulders bunched in anger, and wondered what had happened to the woman who was a thunderbolt, a storm cloud, a panther. Of all things Pinion looked most like a wound.”<br /><br />The Masquerade Empire is defined by its use of masks – even the Emperor wears one at all times, hiding his true self from the world. A mask is a perfect symbol for how it operates, as the Empire's every action hides an ulterior meaning. Take the witch-hunt against same-sex couples, for instance: the Empire preaches the concept of tribadism and sodomy only to fabricate a justification for control. It needs a reason to turn people against each other, making them agree to the formation of a state of vigilance and punishment – and being a taboo, there’s no better candidate for chastisement than sex.<br /><br />But Baru’s intelligence and proficiency with numbers get her the attention of Cairdine Farrier, a conspicuous wool merchant from the Empire who decides to take her under his wings. It’s not her mathematical prowess alone that fascinates Farrier, however, as Baru’s willingness to play the Empire’s game is fundamental for his patronage. When a friend tells Baru that her old tutor wants to touch her, Baru goes to Farrier, who talks at length about the consequences of angering a powerful man. Baru understands, then, that the Empire’s society is based on a system that rewards silence and conformity, where abusers can flourish. And Baru chooses silence: “It’s not worth losing his patronage over this. ‘All right,’ she said. ‘Forget I asked.’ Cairdine Farrier smiled in pleased relief.”<br /><br />This scene is key to understanding Baru – the lengths she’s willing to go to stick to her plan of rising within the Empire’s ranks. This won’t be the last moment she will opt for turning a blind eye and betray her beliefs, and then frame her decision as a sacrifice necessary for the greater good – believing it will allow her to climb to a position from where she’ll be able to stop these horrible things from ever happening again. Cairdine Farrier, of course, witnesses all of this with a smile on his lips. Tension, therefore, arises from this crucial question: is Baru truly deceiving Farrier about her intentions or is he using her to do the Empire’s bidding until it’s time to clip her wings?<br /><br />As a test, Carrier sends Baru – only eighteen years old at the time – to the province of Aurdwynn as an Imperial Accountant, after the previous two died there. The region – ruled by warring dukes – has a past marked by rebellion and she is tasked to rekindle its flames once more. Baru’s time in Aurdwynn makes the bulk of the novel: this is the story of how the Empire asks Baru to infiltrate the dukes’ rebellion just so she can deceive it at a crucial time – hence the novel’s title.<br /><br />The Traitor Baru Cormorant is at its best when developing its title character. The things she sacrifices to become a servant of the Empire, for example, grow exponentially with each passing page, which starts to affect her identity. Baru’s mother warns her, before she leaves Taranoke, “Go, then. Learn all their secrets. Cover yourself in them. You will return with a steel mask instead of a face.” And it doesn’t take long for Baru to realize the meaning of these words. She has to shut down her feelings so often – lest they betray her plan –that she starts to become the cold machine she pretends to be: “When she was alone again Baru snuffed out all the candles and thus hidden from herself she tried to let herself weep in fear. Still it would not come. She had built the dams too strong, polished the gears too perfectly.”<br /><br />Baru is also often tempted by power – she enjoys its intoxicating effect – which is possibly why Farrier put her still so young in a position of so much prestige and influence in Aurdwynn. There’s this great scene where she meets a man conditioned to be a slave, a man who was tortured and brainwashed to the point where he is now grateful for any opportunity to serve his masters. Baru has the chance of becoming such a master, so it’s telling how she tries to make up excuses to seize the opportunity: “Was it really slavery if the slave was grateful? If that gratitude had been hammered into the alloy of his being?” she questions.<br /><br />The novel’s main theme arises precisely from the questions related to Baru’s arc. Is there a difference between a traitorous servant and a loyal one if they all still serve in the end? If Baru, with all her plans of treason, is more efficient in her job than even the most loyal of officials, isn’t she more useful to the Empire than them? As Baru’s plan is to rise in the ranks, she forces herself to remain silent before injustice, becoming complicit to it – sometimes she even becomes the very agent of injustice, perpetrating it with her own hands. Baru is willing to sacrifice not only her soul, but also the lives of countless others to achieve her goal, but that may end up being just for the benefit of her enemies.<br /><br />The narrative, however, succeeds in making Baru’s plan make sense from a practical point of view. The Empire is built as not only a cunning, rich, and ruthless force but also one in possession of a fearsome military power. Therefore, open revolt, such as the rebellion in Aurdwynn, seems hopeless: this is why Baru’s task is to make it come out, so the Empire can single out each traitorous individual in a controlled scenario, for it sees much more danger in the shadows than in open defiance.<br /><br />And it’s not an easy job for Baru, as Aurdwynn is framed as a very dangerous place: of the two prior accountants, one was executed for giving in to the rebellion, and the other was assassinated for refusing to give in. Baru’s task feels more like a trap than a test, then, even if she seems capable of handling it, using her new job to the fullest effect: “She would open the books and search for signs of seditious behavior – enthusiastic loan taking, aggressive investment in old coin or hard resources, purchases of weapons or grain to feed and fight a rebellion.”<br /><br />The narrative only falters when it comes to building the dukes of Aurdwynn: even though they are key players in the rebellion, they remain mostly distant and elusive. Unexekome, Lyxaxu, Nayarru, all these dukes, they are more enigmas than anything: we know they possess hidden agendas, but not what these are until they decide to make their move. Unfortunately, this means that these characters remain one-note for the most part of the novel: we have the duke who is a pirate, the one who likes philosophy, the one who is an ambitious woman, and so forth.<br /><br />At first, this approach works because it contributes to the feeling of unease and paranoia in Aurdwynn, with Baru not knowing who to approach and who to avoid, as everyone appears to be an enemy disguised as a friend – the “Judge” figure, Xate Yawa, is the character that most benefits from this ambivalence. Later on, however, when the focus turns to the rebellion itself, these characters are supposed to become tragic figures – if the Empire has its way, that is – but it’s hard to mourn or cheer the fate of enigmatic people.<br /><br />The notable exception is the Duchess Tain Hu, who can shift from being a fearsome enemy to an unwavering ally in the blink of an eye – depending on what side she believes Baru’s on at the moment, if Aurdwynn or the Empire. Tain Hu tries to get close to this foreign, young, and beautiful accountant to discover what motivates her, and she’s mostly successful: “A people can only bear the lash so long in silence. Some things are not worth being within,” Tain Hu warns Baru early in the story. “Order is preferable to disorder,” Baru responds, “speaking words she had mocked on Taranoke, under the dark hangings of the school beds.”<br /><br />However, what starts as a cold political move – Tain Hu needs to know if Baru can be trusted – starts to grow into something more personal. There’s always a hint of desire in their interactions, which makes the prospect of Baru’s potential betrayal much more hurtful: “Baru squeezed her shoulder, comrade to comrade. For a few moments Tain Hu leaned against her, in acknowledgment, or to get a little warmth.”<br /><br />This potential relationship is crucial for Baru because it also represents what the Empire would deny everyone to have. If they knew what she feels for Tain Hu, they would punish her severely. The Empire operates in the realm of repression – social repression, but also repression of feelings and desire –, so Baru’s growing affection towards the duchess becomes an ambivalent symbol: it is what she’s fighting for, but also what she must be willing to sacrifice.<br /><br />The Traitor Baru Cormorant is a powerful first chapter to Baru’s story, successfully creating a complex and tragic protagonist, who finds herself caught in an inscrutable web of political intrigue, but believes she must sacrifice everyone at her side just so she can become the next spider.<br /><br />---&gt; If you liked this review, visit us at <a href=\"https://litonthespot.com/the-traitor-baru-cormorant/books/review\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">LIT ON THE SPOT</a> for more!"

      "review": "9+ what to say about this book? To say that I enjoyed it would not do justice to the truth, or it would be an admission that I am a masochist. It's not feel good fantasy. Far from it. But it takes the reader on an emotional journey, securely building op the protagonist, her dilemma's and the world she inhabits. As a reader you know what ultimate purpose drives Baru Cormorant and why she feels justified to use any means to reach it. But you also get to know the people of Aurdwynn, and the land, and the customs, and grow to love this richly described world. And these sentiments are diametrically opposed. I was almost tempted to stop reading at the end, as I saw heartbreak coming from a mile away ... More than with any other book I read recently I felt a knot in my stomach from fearful anticipation, and the way it all came together made me feel more despair than any books conclusion had lately. Harrowing is the right word for it and as you close the last page you are left wrung out. So, no enjoyment, but a book that can create this strong mix of feelings in me, the reader, deserves my respect, and I will certainly read on in this series.<br />This is low fantasy (agressively so, for there is no magic in almost all of this book - only some vague suggestions in the end, and people created to be obedient in all things - but that could have a scientific explanation). The world building though is well thought out. Also, this is a fantasy novel in which the economic basis of society is well thought out. I didn't think I would find the viewpoint of an accountant interesting, but Baru uses her economical knowledge in interesting ways. The comments in this novel about empire and colonization - and how changing the culture of a population (like e.g. missionaries did) is a tool of empire. How many indigineous cultures had their identity stolen from them to fit them in a western mold - so they would fit more easily in a western way of doing things? The only criticism I have is that events unspool very swiftly. There is less build up and less description than usual in fantasy novels. This could have been two hundred pages longer. The author makes good use of suggestion and implication, and he could not give his main character more interiority without betraying the main plot (this is an issue when your main characters motivations have to remain a secret for the reader). This means that as a reader you are kept at a distance. You see events happening without feeling like you're in the midst of them. But as you can see from my introduction, this is something that could have made the book even better, but did not lessen my interest and reaction to the plot really that much. <br />So, really recommended for the reader bored with traditional fantasy and interested in a modern take that has complex personalities and economic considerations as a part of world building. Oh, and readers that do not mind to have their hearts broken."

      "review": "\"Mother, why do they come here and make treaties? Why do we not go to them? Why are they so powerful?\"<br />This line, spoken by the protagonist Baru near the beginning of the book, sets the tone for the rest of the novel. The first thing I thought of when I read that was, \"well, I know SOMEONE read Guns, Germs and Steel.\" That book seeks to answer that question: why do some kingdoms, nations and empires conquer so thoroughly while others, who seemingly had the same opportunities, end up becoming the ones conquered? The Traitor Baru Cormorant doesn't necessarily answer that question, so much as allow the reader to live it, through the eyes of the title character.<br /><br />The Traitor is about a girl whose home becomes conquered, not with fire and steel, but with money and paper and medicine and ideals. She grows up and watches her friends, family and traditions slowly disappear, becoming replaced by new ones installed by the Empire of Masks. The book provides a unique take on the revenge story, for it doesn't provide a single tragic moment that all the character's hate can be traced toward. The destruction of her family and home come in a casual, systematic manner, which is perhaps how Baru learns patience as she seeks to rise in this seemingly unstoppable empire and conquer them from within.<br /><br />This book is not a light read, at least not for me. In the country of Arduwynn, where Baru seeks to begin her revenge, there are a dozen dukes and many other side characters to keep track of. There are very few wasted characters, as everyone Baru meets seems to have some sort of hold on her, or influence her in some way or another. Though none so much as the duchess Tain Hu, who will constantly make Baru challenge her belief system. The author also doesn't waste time getting to the point. There may be pages of dialogue and intrigue and then action will drop on the reader like an anvil. I found myself reading certain passages multiple times to make sure I wasn't mistaken and that YES, that really did just happen. It might be challenging, but it's also very rewarding and full of surprises and gut wrenching turns.<br /><br />This is a powerful book and it asks a lot of powerful questions. Can you truly change something you hate without it changing you? How do you weigh the things you love? Where do you draw the line on what you will sacrifice in order to achieve your goals? At what point have you become the very thing you detest?<br /><br /> I definitely felt pangs of The Long Price Quartet, by Daniel Abraham as I read this, as well as Arkady Martine's Memory Called Empire. If you enjoyed those books, you will definitely enjoy this. If you are into political fantasy with poetic characters, filled with intrigue and battle and tragedy, the Traitor is one you should not miss."

      "review": "Audiobook and ebook. Whispersync (when it worked).<br /><br />SPOILERS! Don’t read unless you’ve read The Traitor Baru Cormorant.<br /><br />This novel was sublime. Simply sublime. I was hesitant when I heard the writer was a writer on Destiny simply because the story in Destiny had potential but was opaque without being able to deliver on that quality in any substantial way. I was worried this novel would be the same.<br /><br />I needn’t have worried.<br /><br />The author carries some of that same opaqueness in his writing here, but it comes across more as subtle and evocative than camouflage for answers even the writer doesn’t know (think Lost or, well, Destiny). Here, likely because the author isn’t writing by committee, the subtlety leads to answers and plot movement and consequences. <br /><br />Big consequences.<br /><br />In every paragraph, you can find a line that evokes much more than the writer is saying, lines that caused me to consider just where the narrative was driving and what the characters were really thinking. There’s a surface to this story and there is the depth below, and each line limns the surface and hints at what’s beneath with skill that was perfectly balanced for me.<br /><br />Does that mean the entire novel was perfect? Nope. I feel like the subtlety, the skipping around the edges led to some disconnection between the reader and the many characters. Did I care for them? Only very few. Did I know much about them? Only enough to become invested in the plot (as opposed the the characters’ places in the plot). And the character names? Thankfully, the audiobook helped me situate the consonant/vowel clusters on my reading tongue. A last criticism: one or two neat coincidences stood out as, well, a little too neat.<br /><br />As the story crescendoed, I was certain where it was headed—partially because, of course, the title of the novel calls Baru a traitor and partially because I knew the writer was too crafty to settle on the initial turncloaking (verbing that, thanks) as the entire justification of the title. It was clear she’d turn again, but I’d decided she’d simply turn on her love, Tain Hu, in order to stay leader of the rebellion. At no point did I consider she’d never actually turned her cloak against the rebellion by never, at the start, ever turning her back on the Masquerade.<br /><br />But I should have know. It was Baru’s driving motivation from the very first chapter: infiltrate the empire to destroy it from the inside. The only was to do that was to ascend into the empire, to sit behind the throne, and the only way to do that was to stay true to the Mask while rebelling. Subtle layers upon layers of subterfuge mirroring the subtle layers of words building into sentences.<br /><br />This novel, The Traitor Baru Cormorant, is one of my very favorite novels of the decade and certainly in my top 50 of all time. I recommend fans of good writing and storytelling, irrespective of genre (this is Hard Fantasy, by the way, with the fantastical elements very, very, very sparse—really, in my view, just the Clarified) read this SUBLIME novel."

      "review": "When I finished this book a couple of days ago I was very uncertain about the rating, because I could not decide between an objective evaluation and personal feelings toward the story and the main character Baru Cormorant.<br />I was sure only of the first adjective I could think about both: disturbing.<br />Listening to my feelings, even if the book is definitely a very good one, I would have given 2 stars.<br /><br />The setting of the story is a world dominated by an empire that conquers with finance and diseases, brainwashing the younger generations to ensure the conquered countries will remain willingly part of the empire, and imposing its moral and philosophy to different cultures. <br />Besides the empire is only apparently ruled by an emperor and a parliament.<br />The real power is in the hands of a mysterious group, acting behind the scenes but with absolute control over everything and everyone.<br />Well, that sounded to me like several films and books based on the theory of conspiracy, where the main power ( usually USA) is actually dominated by a secret group, moved by financial interests, and set to dominate the world through the globalisation.<br />I am not saying that this is the message of this book, but at the end these ideas came to my mind immediately.<br />Since I do not believe to such ideas, I found the whole main plot very unlikely, even for a fantasy book.<br />Probably it is because I do not want to the believe that such world could exist and surely I do not even like to read about it.<br />However I admit that, both in the book and in the real world, it might be possible that nations are willing to spread diseases, decimating the population, in order to buy the survivors with medicines and civilisation, taking then advantage of the resources of the conquered country and subjugating the survivors brainwashing their children in special schools.<br />Very unlikely but not completely impossible, that is why I found the book disturbing.<br /><br />Even more disturbing and unpleasant is the main character Baru Cormorant.<br />I always like, and I am sure I am not only one, to identify myself with the characters, even if they are not heroes.<br />Everybody would like to be like Druss the Legend or maybe Anomander Rake.<br />Here instead I do not like anything of Baru.<br />Would I like to be her? No<br />Would I act like her in the same situation? No<br />Would I like to be able to act like her? No <br /><br />So, I do not like the world and I like even less the main character, why the 4 stars?<br />Because as I said the book is very well written and full of twists, but the main reason is that after 3 days I am still thinking about it.<br />It left me with contrasting feelings, it disturbed me and it made me think to several issues that probably were not even intended by the author.<br />That for me is worth at least 4 stars.<br /><br />P.S. <br />This year I read also \"The Dagger and the Coin\".<br />It seems that accountants with a deep love for alcohol are becoming quite common.<br />I hope it is not like that in real life as well....:)<br /><br />"

      "review": "So I read The Traitor Baru Cormorant and was...underwhelmed. The worldbuiliding was interesting and believable at first, but when you get too close a look at how perfectly Oppressive the Oppressive Evil Empire is, credibility started to slack off. What with the descriptions of all the prisoners they allow to escape in order to recapture them just to imbue with the necessary hopelessness (at apparent risk and waste of manpower), the absolutely perfect brainwashing (an oxymoronic concept, considering the fiddliness of brains) of superhuman servant drones, the whole thing about the true government of this perfectly oppressive empire being in the hands of a bunch of decentralized operatives (in a world where communications is at eighteenth century speed) who work in distrustful cross-purposes and yet are somehow a twisted meritocracy...my mind just put the whole thing down and backed away. I find it hard to believe in THAT perfect a tyranny run by imperfect human beings. <br /><br />Not to mention how fundamentally absurd it was for the aristocrats planning a rebellion to choose as their leader and monarch a foreign member of the governing empire whose loyalty must always remain suspect. Yes, I know, the aristocrats quarrel so bitterly they could never choose one of their own - still bull. Equally absurd is the idea that the common people rebelling would choose to rally round and offer up their lives for a banker who offered them easy credit loans, and never apparently interacted with them beyond chatting up actresses in bars.<br /><br />But all this could have been overlooked were it not for the main problem...Baru Cormorant herself. I think it was pretty heavily telegraphed from early on that all the carefully drawn allies she was drawing around her would eventually turn to her and say \"curse your sudden yet inevitable betrayal!\" This should have had a huge emotional impact on Me the Reader, but it didn't, because I couldn't engage with adult Baru Cormorant. As a child I could relate to her...as an adult, I read her without feeling her. This is a huge problem. While her final betrayal was being telegraphed, I should have thinking, \"No, I totally believe she likes these people, is bound emotionally to their struggle, is in fact half in love with that one, SURELY she wouldn't do that...\" Instead, I was thinking that she didn't seem to care deeply - and so, looking through her eyes, I couldn't either...and the impact of the Reveal was lessened enormously.<br /><br />Now, I get that the author had a big problem on his hands, withholding crucial information from the reader till his Big Reveal. And if Baru got too emotional about it, it might clue the reader too early to what that Reveal would be. I still think, however, that he could have skillfully chosen to show us more anguish and conflict within her without showing us the source of that anguish and conflict. For example, instead of only getting upset about the name of her homeland being changed, she could actually have received letters from home from her family that twist her heart. IMO, attachments to actual PEOPLE that you would do terrible things for beat attachments to alphabetical arrangements every time. But I could never get a sense that Baru was deeply attached to anyone or anything.<br /><br />And maybe that was the point - that the author was trying to give us a view through the eyes of a sociopath. One of the criteria for being one is that you HAVE no deep feelings for anyone or anything. That would be a challenging aim for an author - the danger being that the lack of affect will infect the reader as well. Like when I put the book down with a sigh and said, \"Well, THAT was a mildly depressing and disappointing resolution that threw all the previous flaws noted into sharp relief instead of making them worthwhile to overlook. Oh well.\"<br /><br /><br />"

      "review": "<i> This review contains spoilers. </i><br /><br /><b> \"My lady, command me.\" </b><br /><br />Allow me, if I may, to share the reading journey I shared with Baru Cormorant. . .<br /><br />Around about 40% of the way through this book, I was struggling and thinking that it might just scrape a 3 star rating. <br /><br />Fast forward to the finish and I have decided on an easy 4.5 stars (though 5 stars on paper - because we were always told to round up during Maths!)<br /><br /><b>\n  <i> \"Here - take a coin. Go buy a mango and bring it back to me, and I'll cut you a piece.\"<br />Baru kept the coin. </i>\n</b><br /><br />Baru Cormorant is an outstanding protagonist in so many ways. She is completely committed to everything that she does. She is calculating, patient, methodical. <br /><br />And utterly, utterly ruthless.<br /><br />Yet despite the ruthlessness. Despite the macabre things that she ends up instigating throughout the book, I was still wholeheartedly rooting for her. Her relationships are always set in motion with the bigger picture in mind. She frequently refers to the other characters as 'pieces' that need to be moved around, manipulated, and played in such a way to enable her to come out on top and fulfill her sole desire - to reverse the destruction wrought upon her homeland by the Masked Throne and the Masquerade. <br /><br />So the political intrigue is tangible throughout. The characters all serve their purpose, both for Baru, and for the story as a whole. The world presented is deliciously dark and cruel.<br /><br />But the books ultimate strength, without a doubt, is the romance (this coming from a humble reviewer who usually finds romance dull and uninspiring).<br /><br /> <i>\n  <b> \"She tucked a lock of wild hair behind her ear. It slipped loose at once.\" </b>\n</i><br /><br />This. THIS is how one writes romance. Her relationship with Tain Hu is not all giddy and soppy. It builds slowly and deeply. It is unpredictable. It is raw. It's engrossing and passionate and yet, perhaps throughout the entirety of the book, they share just one night together. <br /><br />It's real. The decisions that Baru makes, right at the end, are simply devastating. The fact that despite everything, she tried to save her. The enforced coldness Baru must show towards her one great love to survive and the fact that Tain Hu accepts and even encourages it, knowing full well the implications it will hold for her. <br /><br />It's utterly heartbreaking. <br /><br /> Tain Hu will take her rightful place upon the list of my favourite book characters ever. She begins as this playful individual with an ever-present sense of danger and threat to Baru and ends as someone fiercely loyal, unequivocally brave and dignified beyond reason or fairness. I was desperate to see her pull through to the end. <br /><br />However, there are reasons why this book is not an out-and-out 5 stars.<br /><br />Firstly, the first 40% was a real chore, centered on Baru's attempts to fix Aurdwynn's mounting monetary issues. She is, after all, an accountant. But reading about these issues was not particularly inspiring and I found myself glazing over the financial jargon that flies off the page at this stage in the story. <br /><br />Secondly, much of the second half of the book, despite it's greatness, reads more like a commentary on a great historical event, sweeping over large-scale events and battles and who killed who, which lacks the warmth and heart of the exchanges between the characters. <br /><br />But despite these things, I would not hesitate to recommend this to anyone who wishes to be challenged by morally ambiguous characters, who is stimulated by the intricate and bothersome problem of taking down an institution and who strives to find a romance worth wishing for.

      "review": " The Traitor Baru Cormorant is a book that makes me want to be a writer, while simultaneously making me despair of ever doing so half as well as the author.<br /><br /><b>This is a book which flenses your heart.</b><br /><br />Like Baru, it is an examination of power and control. How are we shaped by power when we wield it? When it is wielded against us? When we turn to the tools of our oppressors to rise, is it by our design or theirs? It is no accident that core players of the Masquerade seek to understand the nature of power; they wade in a sea of it and seek to understand the very core elements. What is controlled by nature? What is controlled by nurture?<br /><br />This is a book which offers hard lessons, but no answers. It offers hope, but never without pain. There is no progress without abandoning the past. When we abandon that past, what else do we leave behind?<br /><br />It does all of this with some of the best craftsmanship I’ve seen. The prose is beautiful and intentional to a degree I rarely see. It rewards deeper, active reading. Pacing itself serves the narrative and amplifies the feelings of the characters. When the book is making you feel a thing, whether by tone, plot, or pace, it is always in service of the story. Upon a first read, I followed the story with my heart in my throat. It left me a ruin, dashed against the rocks, hopeless against a rising tide. Upon a reread, I appreciated how things could never have turned out any differently, and went to my fate willingly. Even with all of its strategies and schemes ostensibly laid bare, knowing what was to come, I could find the beauty. I could not help but yield my heart in service of its grand designs, and was rewarded with subtler details I missed before, fresh ecstasy and suffering, not unlike seeing your love in the crowd on the way to your execution. Upon a third read, I was able to grasp how even the prose and word choice reinforces the themes, choices and outcomes of the book, what they tell you about Baru herself, how with the waves rising she clings to the chains which anchor her to the bedrock. How she is willing to give all of herself for that which she has pledged herself for.<br /><br />Characters, even the reprehensible or minor “bit” players are all fantastically realized and fit within the tragic world. While they could never do other than they have, they all feel like other players in the game. No decision feels unnatural, or delivered solely to advance the story. They seem to have agency, despite being fictional characters on a page. A fitting mirror to the themes of the book if ever there was one.<br /><br />I’ve read the book three times since release, and this is the first time I’ve felt able to process my thoughts afterword, rather than being left a waterlogged corpse for days. Eventually, rather than having to face the emotional reckoning, I would choose to look away. It moved me in a way that has required compartmentalization, sealing it off in a forgotten corner of my brain to be function again, leaving only a memory that I loved it and it was a special, with only the roughest brushstrokes of plot remaining. Upon the third read, I’m able to maintain enough separation to share my thoughts and admiration in a way that I hope is worthy of what is unabashedly my favorite book of all time.<br /><br /><b>It has written its name in the ruin of me. It has painted itself across my mind in the color of its blood.</b>"

      "review": "I didn’t hate everything about this book. The premise drew me in. There are some overarching themes about power, violence, and corruption that left me thinking about the book for the rest of the day after I finished it. The Empire of Masks is an obvious parallel to imperial and colonial nations in this world that stamp out the cultures of the countries they invade and impose harsh punishments for going against their rules. Baru, being a woman, brown, and lesbian, finds significant hurdles to overcome on her quest to gain power so she can alleviate the yoke of imperial rule in her homeland of Taranoke.<br /><br />Baru is intelligent and ambitious and she works hard on her journey to becoming the Imperial Accountant. As the Accountant situated in the nation of Aurdwynn, Baru is in control of every note of currency borrowed from the bank and taxed in trade. The book is heavy on the economics and politics, sometimes to the detriment of character development and emotional appeal. Baru has to be cold and stoic to accomplish what she does, but her fixation on the structure and logistics of war and hierarchy and economics over everything else made it difficult to empathise with her. While most of Baru and Tain Hu’s scenes together were interesting, Baru’s inability to confide in Tain Hu naturally constrains the extent to which they bond. I wasn’t convinced that Baru was in love with Tain Hu by the end of the book (although I definitely believe Tain Hu was in love with Baru).<br /><br /><input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"spoiler__control\" aria-label=\"The following text has been marked spoiler.

The reviews on the book’s cover spell it out for you, describing it as brutal, gut-wrenching, a tragedy, etc., so yeah, I wasn’t expecting Baru and Tain Hu to ride off into the sunset together. The revelation that the Masquerade engineered the rebellion and Baru’s symbolic place as its leader did not shock me. The narrative hints at this twist a few times as well. I get that Baru truly believes the Masquerade can only be defeated from within—the “you can’t beat them, so join them” mentality.</label><br /> <br /><input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"spoiler__control\" aria-label=\"The following text has been marked spoiler.

It was no less risky. For one thing, why did she even trust that the Empire would give her power if she completed her task? It would surely be easy for them to use her as a puppet for their own schemes. It’s not uncharacteristic of a powerful group to allow certain members of the group they oppress to rise to a high status (socially, politically, or economically) so as to give the illusion that the ruling powers are equal opportunists. <br /><br /><i>Could power be real if someone else gave it to you?</i> Baru asks herself this very question early in the story but finds no certain answer. It would seem that she likes to play with chance.</label><br /><br /><input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"spoiler__control\" aria-label=\"The following text has been marked spoiler.

A few examples to illustrate this: 1) It was very convenient that Purity Cartone survived the harbor attack, got kicked out of Treatymont, and returned to Baru feeding her relevant information and answering only to her orders. 2) Duke Unuxekome, an experienced sailor who knew full well that a small number of Masquerade ships were much more powerful and destructive than the pirate fleets he commanded, attacked the Imperial Navy simply because Baru suggested it. Apparently for this guy, the power of boners is stronger than common sense and survival instincts. 3) When Lyxaxu discovered Baru was planning to betray the rebels, the smart thing to do would have been to approach one of the other dukes and duchesses about what he had found instead of turning on the rebels during the battle and thus appearing the traitor himself. Following that, it was lucky for Baru that Xate Olake, on her command, killed Lyxaxu before he could explain himself.</label><br /><br /><input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"spoiler__control\" aria-label=\"The following text has been marked spoiler.

I’m sure this is supposed to be a message about the seductive corruption of power, but it feels more like a message about the hopelessness of resistance in the face of oppression. I couldn’t really feel sad or disappointed about any of the character deaths because my low expectations made me unable to invest my feelings. But for what it's worth, I liked Tain Hu. Her death was cheap and demeaning to her warm, strong, and loyal character, and I don't forgive male writers for killing lesbian characters. (Well, it's always cheap and demeaning because that's usually all we get.) Otherwise I might have bumped my rating to two stars because this book was such a wild ride.</label> <br /><br /><input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"spoiler__control\" aria-label=\"The following text has been marked spoiler.

      "review": "This book is not for the fainthearted. I'll say that right up front, because it's important, and I don't want to be lashed for not mentioning it. The story is the epitome of the phrase, \"The road to hell is paved with good intentions,\" or as the book puts it before the story even starts, \"A Promise: This is the truth. You will know because it hurts.\" <br /><br />I've never seen an author do that before, but if ever a book lives up to its promise, this one does. <br /><br />This is the story of Baru Cormorant, and her struggle to take down the evil Empire of Masks from the inside out. The Empire conquered her island of Taranoke, not through the usual way--war--but through trade, a treaty, economics, and the promise of better living. Things like antibiotics, dentistry, and roads. Unfortunately the price paid is high: the island's culture is swallowed up and subjugated, its natural resources exploited and stripped, its children indoctrinated into the Imperial way of thinking. (The Empire of Masks is a particularly nasty piece of work; their society is highly homophobic and subscribes to this world's version of eugenics, i.e., forced marriages and people bred like cattle. Undesirables, like Baru, who is a lesbian [or \"tribadist\"], are put to the knife--castrated and/or circumcised--reeducated through use of drugs or a more brutal version of our \"reparations therapy,\" or killed altogether.) Baru, a mathematics savant, is trained to be an Imperial Accountant, and is assigned to the country of Aurdwynn. She is determined to free her home, and is convinced that playing the Imperial game and destroying the Empire from within is the only way to achieve her goal. <br /><br />That description, however, in no way does justice to the brutality and ruthlessness of both this book and its main character. Step by step, we are witness to the creation of a monster, whose obsession leads her to do terrible things. Yet Baru is not a sociopath, not really; she loves, she cries, and she grieves, and she feels every bit of what she is doing, but she will let <i>nothing</i> stand in her way. And so the book's central theme is this: How far will Baru go to get what she wants, and will the time ever come when the ends do not justify the means? What, and who, will she sacrifice to defeat the Empire...and can the Empire ever really be defeated? <br /><br />It's one of the most complex characterizations I've seen in a long time. I was horrified by Baru, and hated her, but I always understood her, and I couldn't take my eyes off her. <br /><br />Baru becomes the Fairer Hand, the leader of Aurdwynn's rebellion. (Not by force of arms, mind you, but by force of <i>numbers.</i> She is still the Imperial Accountant, manipulating currencies and people with equal aplomb.) After one decisive battle, where the rebels of Aurdwynn defeat the Imperial troops, I looked at the number of pages remaining and realized the book couldn't wrap up here. This story could not possibly have a happy ending. <br /><br />It didn't. I won't spoil it, except to remind you that the book's title is <i>The</i> Traitor <i>Baru Cormorant</i>. And yet this book could have ended no other way.<br /><br />It's dark and disturbing, and if you must have optimism in your fiction, you need to stay far away from this one. But if you read this story, it will haunt you for weeks to come. I gave it four stars because of the awkwardness of the first few chapters, dealing with Baru's childhood; once she reaches Aurdwynn, the book blasts on all cylinders. "

      "review": "Baru Cormorant is young enough to remember her island before the Empire of Masks came, the imperialist power that brought new laws, culture, economics, and a thousand other threads with which they now control her home. But Baru has a plan: if she plays her part, becomes a perfect imperial citizen, and makes everyone believe she has fully become the mask, she can rise high enough in the Empire to destroy it from within. But is it even possible to succeed, or will she destroy herself, or destroy everything worth preserving, by the time she gets there?<br /><br />This is yet another book that's commonly recommended for bookish lesbians, to the point where it almost blends into background noise or might be considered overhyped before you've even cracked the spine. Genuinely, the praise is all deserved. The worldbuilding is a masterpiece, the characters all fully-realized, the romance magnetic, the stakes riveting, and it features one of the single most jaw-dropping endings I've ever seen in a book, something that caught me off guard in the best way. (That Baru Cormorant sure can traitor!) It definitely delivers on its promise of dangerous political intrigue where every seemingly minor character has their own motivations they'll act on, and doesn't pull its punches when it comes to forcing Baru to make hard sacrifices and do genuinely heinous things in pursuit of her ultimate goal. Will somehow make even accounting, tax laws, and trade routes interesting. Your life will be improved if you read this book.<br /><br />(The potential pitfalls that might turn people off from this one all ended up being things I prefer in my books, like barrages of worldbuilding that avoid holding my hand and make me juggle pieces of lore when I'm reading, and characters being compelling even when they're making what feels like the wrong decisions or being total assholes. Also, the frankly and blatantly political messaging about how empire changes everything it touches. Even the woman/lesbian-centric thought process really rang true and made me forget a man wrote this. If you have less tolerance for all of this then I don't know what to tell you.)"

Everyone else got the version with a ferocious heroine operating in a taut plot line to overthrown a homophobic colonial empire.<br /><br />Me, I'm stuck with dry prose, a protagonist with less personality than a houseplant (some of my houseplants are pretty personable), and several dump trucks full of exposition.<br /><blockquote>\n  <b>\"You've always been bored by history. It's your greatest weakness.\"</b>\n</blockquote> In the book, Cairdine Farrier, Baru's mentor/nemesis/man of mystery says this to Baru. It's an apt discription of me, as well. (I think a disinterest in dates and dead people is a superpower, but, I digress.)<br /><br />The story follows Baru Cormorant, a young woman whose people have been conquered by the evil, homophobic Masquerade Empire. Before the coming of the Masquerade, Baru lived with her mom and two daddies. When one of her fathers is killed, Baru is enrolled in a Masquerade school, where she learns to be a good citizen, while a plague ravages the land. She graduates with top honors, and at the tender age of eighteen, is sent to a faraway land to hold a prestigious position as an accountant. An imperial comptroller, I guess.<br /><br />There, she uncovers a rebellion against the Masquerade and sets out to find out who is behind it, using her mad accountancy skillz.<br /><br />What follows is an endless litany of names and places, and speculation about those names and places, and a sense that I'm supposed to give a rat's furry little ass about any of it. I don't. Why? Because I don't give a rodent's hirsute derriere about the protagonist.<br /><br />The writing is dry and reporterly, all tell, little show. The death of Baru's father is a bare footnote and young Baru doesn't seem particularly upset. In fact, she's more interested in school, including the homophobic curriculum. Little text is devoted to her culture or people. It isn't until later (100 pages or so), that Baru exhibits any anger about her father or the loss of her homeland. The intent is to show how bottled-up she was as a young child. But the affect is to withhold the protagonist's motivation from the reader. Political intrigue is only effective, for me, anyway, is there's something big at stake. Or, at least, if the protagonist and other characters are compelling. The storytelling in <i>The Traitor Baru Cormorant</i>, however, never let me into anyone's headspace, and felt like viewing scenes underwater, blurry and distant.<br /><br />The novel's strongest point is the worldbuilding with the Masquerade being particularly fascinating. The regime is depicted as rigidly puritanical toward sexuality, and yet, not bound by the usual patriarchal standards. More interesting is the practice of educating the children of the conquered and lifting them to high positions in their society. This is a society where women hold a good deal of power, including in the military. The juxtaposition between a mindset that persecutes gays and lesbians while simultaneously possessing a progressive view toward women is a brilliant twist.<br /><br />Baru, a woman and ethnic minority, nevertheless gets the opportunity to have a good career. But to do so, she much deny an essential part of self, her sexual orientation. With the right approach to character development, this could have been a breathtaking story. Without a compelling protagonist to anchor the story, the narrative with its necessary reliance on expansive history lessons and political factoids, falls flat.<br /><br />New year, new approach to \"Meh\" books. On to something entertaining. (I paid cashy money for this thing so \"Yes,\" I can review it even if I didn't finish it.)"

Narratively, I can look back and see the warning flags of Baru’s betrayal but fuck bro that hurt and not in a good way. There’s no attempt to backtrack from her choice—she instead obliterates any and all character growth and allows Tain Hu to die rather than create a vulnerability and that just… idk wasn’t fucking ok to me. Y’all could have figured that shit out in book 2!!! It was very much a “Bury your Gays” and I’m just so fucking sick of seeing lesbians being portrayed as these selfish, bloodthirsty people who can’t be trusted bc they’re liars and predators. <br /><br />I’ve seen this book recommended alongside books like Gideon the Ninth but I disagree. Similarities are surface level. While major deaths are both featured at the end, GtN’s major death gives its character the dignity of choice. Tain Hu received no much treatment. <br /><br />While I am queer, I’m not POC so I won’t say my opinion is law on the imperialism themes. But, those seem like they might have potential. I thought the idea of politics and economics as a form of conquest was very interesting and I liked seeing how the machine worked, which is why it’s getting 2 stars. <br /><br />However, I don’t think I’ll stick around long enough to see them develop. My involvement w this series ends with The Traitor Baru Cormorant. I just can’t swallow the treatment of its queer characters. "

I will say that if you are looking for a sci fi/ fantasy political intrigue with a queer woman as protagonist similar to the vast majority of this book (the rebellion section where you think Baru supports it) just read A Memory Called Empire instead. But the twisty ending definitely differs, as do the Machiavellian themes. I liked it, I just was not massively convinced by Baru's genius which made much of the intrigue fall flatter. I will be continuing with the series however (if I can get my hands on the next book)"

      "review": "This is one heck of a book. <br /><br />It can be seen in many different ways. A geopolitical fantasy, LGBT oppression, the effects of colonialism, imperialism, etc. But in my mind it is a simple revenge story at its very basic foundation.<br /><br />We start off with the introduction of a prodigy named Baru living in a coastal region called Taranoke. She is very curious about how the world (especially trade) works. Her curiosity is encouraged by a loving mother and 2 fathers with various skill sets. <br /><br />The world that they inhabit is dominated by an imperial force called the Masquerade. The Masquerade expands its power through its economic prowess initially. Once it has taken over a region, it imposes its set of beliefs on the citizens. Those beliefs include queer oppression, eugenics, extensive spy network within the public which is very similar to SS during the Nazi times. <br /><br />Now, Baru's Taranoke is the Masquerade's latest target. Due to their gradual invasion, Baru ends up losing a father, a pleasant childhood as well as Taranoke's natural way of life. She vows to bring down the Masquerade from the inside by biding her time and climbing the bureaucratic ladder. <br /><br />Once her training and exams are complete, she is promoted to the post of Imperial Accountant for Aurdwynn. Aurdwynn is a region divided into smaller parts led by various Dukes &amp; Duchesses. There is a rebellion in motion and various materials as well as money being funnelled cleverly.<br /><br />This book is very much driven by a strong plot. Hence, the less we go into it the better. In terms of style, it is very much focused on what a country, rebellion or an army runs on. Aurdwynn's economy and resources are broken down multiple times over the course of this story. The various nobles and their motives are also de-constructed according to the rapidly changing loyalties. Even financial policies are laid out in a relatively detailed manner. If you have a working knowledge of how these concepts work in real life, you should be able to run with the events easily. I loved the intrigue, policies and the rapid pace of the plot. <br /><br />The protagonist herself has to go through various extreme situations for her main goal to be achieved. The decisions she has to take and the people she ends up hurting constantly test her resolve. Is she willing to give up her mission for a new life? A new life which might even lead to happiness? How many innocent people can she sacrifice for the greater good? All of these dilemmas are dealt with beautifully. <br /><br />What didn’t work is the lack of world building at necessary points. Some groups of people are mentioned in passing and just reinforced through repetition. Even the various cruel policies enforced on the public are not delved into at length. It is just a feeling of dread enforced through repetition. <br /><br />Once I got past the first few chapters, I couldn’t put the book down. If you enjoy a great character set in a dark world which is full of intrigue and economic details, then this is definitely for you."

I loved the premise of this book and was very excited to jump right into this world. Somewhere around the 30% mark, the story took a turn I was not too sure about, but thankfully, it won be back by 75% and held on until the end. Afro-based fantasies are my absolute favorite, so I had extremely high expectations of this novel. I'm not sure if it was because of these expectations, or my previously wonderful experience with this author, but the writing style /story telling was a little hard for me to connect with in this novel .<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed the worldbuilding, especially the Fae world, and the vibes in this book. My favorite parts were the character diversity, the afro based magic linked to the drums, the queer normative society, the disabled representation, sapphic romance, and the animal connections. The drum magic in this story is unique, and I loved that the author created something special. I also enjoyed the buildup of the enemies' to lovers relationship, but once established, it fell a bit flat for me. The other romance started off a bit rough but transitioned a little better. <br /><br />What didn't work for me was the distance felt between the characters and myself as a reader. I could not fully connect with the characters, and I did not feel a sisterly connection between Yeeran and Lettle, even though they are the main voices within this story. At times, they come across as robotically doing things for each other, rather than me feeling/experiencing the deep love that we are told about. Some of the thought processes, conversations, and decisions of the characters felt a bit juvenile even though these were all grown adults. As a commander, Yeeran came off a bit naive and idealistic about the realities of war, and oftentimes left me exasperated by her thoughts and plans. At other times, the switch in povs threw me off as it felt like a repetition of the previous chapter, pushed back in time, with not much new information being discovered. <br /><br />My favorite characters were Rayan, Furi, and Pila - they were the ones operating with the most logic lolol. I look forward to reading other installments in this series and the authors' other books!"

It comes out on January 23 in the states, and I need everyone to pre-order or pick up your copy the day it comes out! <br /><br />In a world where Fae, Human, and Elf lived harmoniously in a distant and forgotten past, the only race still alive are the Elves. But their lives are riddled with fighting and famine in a never-ending war. This story follows Yeeran, a Colonel in the war, and Lettle, her younger sister who follows a path of divination to foretell prophecies of the future. When events happen that see Yeeran exiled, Lettle leaves to follow her sister into the lands beyond the Elfish boarders. What follows is a story of finding a way to persevere when even fate seems to be working against you. <br /><br />Some things I loved about this book: <br /><br />✅ African and Arab inspired worlds with all main characters being brown/black and absolutely STUNNING!<br />✅ Some amazing disability representation<br />✅ Diversity in Elf/Fae type fantasy worlds! I loved seeing it! <br />✅ Sapphic enemies-to-lovers! <br />✅ Friends-to-Lovers hetero relationship (The slow burn/pining of Rayan and Lettle is so swoon-worthy)<br />✅ A very queer normal world. All Fae and Elves accept a person no matter the gender or the sexual orientation. It’s just a way of life! <br />✅ The most epic animal companions in the Obeahs. I need one in my life! <br /><br />I could wax poetic about this for hours, but I want you to be able to experience the amazing story and twists of this world on your own as well! <br /><br />Thanks to #NetGalley and #DelRey of #PenguinRandomHouse for sending me a free ARC of #Faebound by #SaaraElArifi for an honest, spoiler-free review!

      "review": "3.5? This book was fundamentally entertaining to read. It had some brilliant creative ideas in terms of worldbuilding, i love the Obeah and the entire magic system, as well as the emphasis on complex politics despite its status as romantasy- the romance itself was not overtly dominating. The characters as individuals were for the most part very well rounded and identifiable, and I found it very easy to understand and root for them, I liked the contradicting view points. Even the side characters were given at least some measure of depth. Yeeran's romance was almost perfect, but could have been a little more slow paced- (angst, please), still, I adored them together. I wasn't as sold on Rayan and Lettle- I liked the idea of them, but I feel that Rayan didn't get as much attention as other characters, and their relationship seemed pretty rushed and superficial due to this. They sprung into something incredibly meaningful with no build up. The book has some beautiful writing, but the poetic prose is not consistent throughout- a lot of the time it is simple and to the point writing, which i am not averse to. A few parts felt a little juvenile/ ya, with predictable/ obvious plot points and twists, and place names with no creativity comparative to the character names, which fit a lot better within the fantasy world. I feel that some of the book lingered on points that could be cut down- there was a lot of theorising and repetivness, and the plot ceased to move forward in swathes of time, while other parts were rushed. I heard that this book was written in a very short period of time, and I think, in some ways you can tell. However, the representation is phenomenal, and heart warming to see, from black characters to LGBTQ+, normalising non- binary and queer rep, and even disability rep. I think if you like SJM or the premise of her books, while not wanting to or no longer supporting her as an author and recognising how problematic she and her books are, this is where you need to be. It has that same addictive fantasy appeal, but it is just better."

      "review": "The Eleven lands have long been caught in the Forever War with four tribes fighting for their honor and pride on the bleeding fields. A rising soldier endlessly loyal to the Waning Tribe, Yeeran, lets her ambition consume her, resulting in the worst mistake of her career and a questionably deserving punishment: exile. Lettle abandons her divination practice to follow Yeeran into the forsaken outskirts because, like her sister, she is also miserably loyal. But as they try to find each other, they also come across secrets about their world that could help their cause in the war or make it a hell of a lot worse. <br /><br />My description insinuates the book as more of the fantasy genre than romance, but rest assured the romance is quite prominent, especially in the latter parts. Fantasy elements lay in the forefront of this novel, but only when necessary, acting more as colorful strokes rather than a broad canvas to set the story on. Despite its prominence, the world building was my main engagement. The author laid a solid base with the war and energy system and painted beautiful sceneries of lush forests, which I rarely every encounter as a setting in fantasies. We need more rainforests! <br /><br />Creativity is not lost on this novel, especially in crafting a queer-normative society. The commitment reaches expanses I haven't seen incorporated in other literature before, especially for the fantasy genre with non-gender conforming non-humans and almost exclusively queer couples. It doesn't come across as a forcefully woven-in element to check the inclusivity box of a To-Include-In-A-Story-To-Make-It-Sell list. In short, the world feels genuine.<br /><br />However, a crafty world does not make for a crafty plot nor crafty characters. Many characters' actions didn't line up with their history or previously established traits. For example, Yeeran makes a critical mistake that only a soldier who recently entered the force and thrusted the title of Captain upon would make, even though she's proven her worth as a respected leader for several years. The same issues with Yeeran's decisions rise over and over again with seemingly no resolve as a means to hold tension between characters. As for Yeeran's love story... let's just say I'm not a fan. Her love interest needs some significant therapy. Alexa, play \"Hot and Cold\" by Katy Perry. <br /><br />As for Lettle, I love strong, confident women, especially ones who are overtly so that you occasionally get irked like Annabeth Chase or Hermione Granger. I could see the potential for that character in Lettle. She was a top student of divination, a practice on its way to obsolescence. But she was one of the few who held on tightly to her beliefs - and it pays off. She's abrasive, but not straightforward. Obsessively loyal, but fears abandonment. <br /><br />Yet, perhaps it was the audiobook narrator's designated tone for the character or maybe it was the writing itself, but I just did not care for Lettle. Even worse, I wish I never saw her on the page. Her love story, which should've spanned several books with a push-pull tension, condensed itself into one novel. Therefore, we never get to see her internally struggle with her feelings. It's as if one main romantic problem consumed her whole being, so when everything buried deep comes out, it feels almost unwarranted. Lettle has all the makings of a flawed character, but her arc unfortunately did not satisfy me. That is my greatest qualm with this novel: to see unfulfilled potential. Truthfully, I'd loved to see her become the villain. <br /><br />There are plot twists I predicted very early on due to the excessively insightful prophecies conjured by Lettle. Nothing short of your standard middle of the lane fantasy plot. Perhaps this novel is only meant to lay the groundwork for more exciting adventures to come.<br /><br />If you're in the mood for rainforest magic and crystal light with a dash of decent-enough character work and story telling, I'd pick this book up. I'll likely pick up the second one too since I am a reluctant optimist."

But when Yeeran unintentionally kills a fae prince, someone who shouldn't even exists, Yeeran, Lettle, and Rayan are unexpectedly thrust into the realm of Mossima, an underground fae city that is even more dangerous for the elves than the battlefield of the forever war.<br /><br />The blurb for this book was so interesting that I knew I wanted to read it as soon as it was released! It was fast paced and I couldn't put it down. I loved following both Yeeran and Lettle as they start to uncover the truths of the fae realm, make friends and enemies, and struggle to fit into a world that was not meant for them. This book had a lot of surprising twists and turns that kept me engaged the entire time.<br /><br />Some things that were really positive features of this novel include the BIPOC and queer representation. There are gender fluid/non binary characters galore, and it features a sapphic romance. I couldn't put the book down due to the fast pacing of the plot and how interesting the world building was.<br /><br />Something that I found needed a bit of work was the romance that Yeeran has. I just found it to be a bit unbelievable given the circumstances, and I never really felt like I was routing for them. The reason why I am giving this book only 4/5 stars is because the sex scenes were not well written. I just wanted to skip right over them, especially because I wasn't too convinced that the romance was realistic.<br /><br />Overall, I think if you are interested in stories where there's a bit of fae mixed with elves, this could be the book for you! Theres also a bit of mystery, although I think a lot of it was easy to figure out due to heavy foreshadowing. This is definitely for the adult age range. I definitely will be continuing on with the series! 4/5 stars<br /><br />Thank you so much to netgalley and Random House Publishing Group for providing an ARC in exchange for an honest review."

I really liked the characters, they were really fleshed out and I thought the queer and disability representation was great. I loved the romance and the spice, wouldn’t have minded more of it. The magic system and the history of the three races was really interesting. Also, the plot was engaging. It was quite slow paced but not in a bad way, it gave us time to know the characters, learn the new world and let the plot develop. Normally, I can guess quite a lot of the ‘twists’ in fantasy, it doesn’t ruin my enjoyment of a book if I do guess it correctly but I was impressed that I didn’t see all of the twists that came along. I really enjoyed that. <br /><br />This is the first time I’ve read this author and I will definitely be looking up her other books (I love romantasy books but I also love epic fantasy which I believe The Ending Fire trilogy is!)

Divination gives us that bucket.’</i>\n</b><br /><br />In ‘Faebound’ we follow Yeeran and Lettle, two sisters who follow the different paths of elven traditions; drumfire in war and divination. After a decision that gets Yeeran exciled, the sisters must find a way to get Yeeran back into the waning tribe. When the sisters cross the fae, a race they though only existed in history, they find themselves in trouble. After being taken back to where the fae reside, the sisters learn, or are forced to, life their life in their new circumstances. As Yeeran has a personal experience with an obeah, things change. With love, pride and honour on the line, Yeeran and Lettle must decide if escaping is still the correct answer. Along the way they must deal with a unloyal royal family, learning the power of fae and fae connections to the elven world that have been hidden for years.<br /><br /><b>\n  <i>‘Where there is value, there is power, and where there is power, violence will always brew.’</i>\n</b><br /><br />This book was incredible. It was my first fairyloot book so I was already just excited about how beautiful it looked but then I started reading and I was hooked. I though the character development was incredible. I loved the uniqueness of the magic system in this book, drumfire was such a cool concept and I hope we see more of that in the next book. I also loved how divination and prophecies played a part in this book. The prophecies allowed me to remain engaged and guessing my theories the whole way through. It also meant there were so many moments that made me gasp out loud when the true meanings of prophecies were revealed. I loved the soul bonding aspect with the obeah, this book just had so many well written, unique ideas. I am so excited for the next book to see how relationships, power and the war develops.<br /><br /><b>\n  <i> ‘Lettle though of her grief then, how it had poured over her like molten iron, burning her skin, the fumes choking and robbing her of air. Then it had solidified, weighing her down with every step, clinging to every movement.’</i>\n</b><br /><br />I adored the love interests and the differences between each sisters relationship with their love interests. I enjoyed how many different relationship dynamics there were; There was family dynamics between main and side characters and romantic relationships for both sisters, queer and straight. The representation, the normal ness of gender fluidity, queerness and also representation of privilege vs not and someone actually talking about that, amazing.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend reading this book. It seems to be a read for a lot of genres in my opinion. There is an air of suspense throughout, with fantasy themes and heavy romance. This book has so many unique concepts that it’s worth the pick up. <br /><br /><b>\n  <i>‘Love and hate are oil and water, seperate but similar, and sometimes they swirl together, making it difficult to tell one from the other.’</i>\n</b><br />"

There were just so many different names and pronouns that I lost track :s<br /><br />First of all, I met this author when she was doing an event in the Netherlands, and I adored her so much that it made me even more excited to read this. The FairyLoot edition is gorgeous, and I was quite excited. <br /><br />I immediately loved the originality of this book. The fact that the featured magic is drum magic was so original, I loved it even more. I’m not usually a big fan of sister stories, but this one was executed so well, that I couldn’t help but love it. It felt as though we started in the middle of the story, with Yeeran as a captain and fighting against a competing tribe. Lettle seemed like an odd character at first, since her divination was quite mysterious, and I loved that she had a shorter arm because of the pox. The fact that they were both older characters was also quite good, and I enjoyed it a lot. The rep in this was great, including the LGBTQ+ representation. The worldbuilding was also exquisite, it was so fully developed and original, it’s been a while since I’ve read a fantasy that wasn’t basic and kind of unoriginal. The prophecies added a lot of mystery, and every time I though I had it figured out, a new element was added, which could also be the meaning. So cool! I also loved how the gender of the Fae was fluid, because it fits well with the free spirit image I have of them, including them being vegetarian because they don’t eat others. <input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"spoiler__control\" aria-label=\"The following text has been marked spoiler.

I don’t know, they basically were in love from the second they met each other, and I just feel like the development was lacking there. I also didn’t trust Salawa at all, probably because their relationship was more tell than show, and she was a dick from the second we met her lol. </label> Furthermore, I really, REALLY don’t understand <input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"spoiler__control\" aria-label=\"The following text has been marked spoiler.

I’m looking forward to seeing how they’ll stop that prophecy though. The ending was just off pace, it felt suddenly so rushed, especially the featured deaths. <br /><br />I truly had so many thoughts while reading that I forgot quite a bit lol, so much was happening that I couldn’t put it down. The worldbuilding and its mystery were truly amazing, and one of the best things about this book. It was so original! I wasn’t that surprised by most of the reveals, but I still enjoyed it a lot. Pila was the best fucking thing, and I adore her. Can’t wait to see even more of her in the next book! I did miss some of the relationship development, especially in Lettle and Rayan, but I enjoyed the story a lot. <br /></label>"

      "review": "Eeeesh... This is one of those instances where I went into this book with the full expectation that I would LOVE it and that unfortunately just did not happen 😬. There were parts that I really enjoyed though. Below is a list (and it does contain spoilers so proceed with caution.)<br /> <br /><b>Things that I liked:</b> <br /><b>Queer norm AND disability norm world</b> - Honestly, one of the things I was most excited about with this book. I loved that one of our main characters is sapphic and how standard queer relationships were within the world. And I enjoyed how there were multiple characters with varying physical disabilities, including our other main POV character.<br /><b>The magic system</b> - VERY cool. I don't think I have ever read about a magic system incorporating drums like this. And the obeah?? LOVED them. It was reminiscent of the daemons in His Dark Materials. <br /><b>The lore and the worldbuilding</b> - LOVED the premise behind the three species and how they came to be. <br /><b>Sister POVs (rather than love interest POVs)</b> - I thought this was a really refreshing change of pace, especially for a Romantasy. I loved the focus on the relationship between the two sisters<br /><b>Rayan’s storyline </b>- to be fair, at first I did not really care for Rayan and he felt a little bland BUT I did love where the author went with his character ARC (and it actually turned out to be the most interesting character arc for me.)<br /><br />So all of these things were great! But unfortunately, there were quite a few things that I really did not like as well. <br /><br /><b>Things that I didn’t like: </b><br /><b>Lettle</b>- I liked her less and less as the story progressed (which is unfortunate considering she is a main POV character) and by the last couple chapters?? She comes off as very selfish and hypocritical. Especially pertaining to Yeeran's decisions at the end. Hopefully that is intentional and addressed later? Idk though. <br /><b>All of the heavy-handed reminders of prophesies made the majority of the plot very predictable.</b> - This was especially frustrating as this is an adult fantasy book. The constant references back to earlier prophecies kept feeling like the author didn't trust the reader to remember. <br /><b>Also all of the Darth Father situations with some of these characters and their “secret” identities.</b>- Truly... it just felt like more instances where I'm not sure if we were supposed to pick up on them immediately... because, I did. <br /><b>The romantic relationships </b>- didn’t really feel authentic or like they had enough time to develop. This was the situation with BOTH couples as they progress. The initial set up for Yeeran and Furi was amazing - a perfect enemies to lovers arc - but then it was \"I hate you\" to one meaningful conversation to \"we're both insanely attracted to one another\" to \"I think I'm in love\"?? And the same really goes for Lettle and Rayan. They had a great start, barely communicated throughout the entire middle, and then Lettle somehow thinks \"Yeah I'm in love with him\".... so I just didn't buy the chemistry in either romance. <br /><b>The spice kind of felt unnecessary</b> - Usually you will never catch me saying this because I love a spicy scene but I think this goes hand in hand with the fact that I did not feel committed to the romance. For me, the spice is always an added bonus after tons of tension and build up. And unfortunately I did not feel either in these relationships. <br /><br />And where does this leave me? Honestly, idk. I see where the series is progressing. But I'm not sure if I'm committed enough to these characters to continue. I think my dislikes outweigh all of the potential this world had for me 😞<br /><br /><i>*The audiobook was good though!

      "review": "3.5🌟 <br />I wanted to love this so bad… Firstly, I love the fact that this is a queer normative world. We get both M/F and F/F romance in this, but IT IS CRUMBS, YALL. Not sure why so many people are calling this a romantasy lol. The disability representation was also great. I’m also a fan of talking animal companions, so I loved that as well. I loved the descriptions and the setting of the fae world, which was just so magical. I like how the author portrayed the sisters’ (Yeeran and Lettle’s) relationship so realistically. I love the entirety of the idea of this book and where the author was TRYING to take this as a political fantasy, but I’m not quite sure it hit the mark.<br /><br />I usually don’t mind world building, but the way it’s done is just so boring. There was nothing to catch my attention until 80% in. EIGHTY PERCENT INTO A 500 PAGE BOOK, Y’ALL. I found it to be extremely predictable. As someone who isn’t good at understanding prophecies or riddles in books, I immediately understood every prophecy in this book. When we first meet who fulfills Lettle’s “last prophecy” it, I immediately knew it was about them. I was shocked by how easy I caught on. I kept second guessing myself, because no way would an adult fantasy book be SO simple. But it was. None of the plot twists were surprising, but what was surprising is how none of the characters caught on to any of the plotting and shenanigans going on. It was all right in front of their faces.<br /><br />Lastly, the insane insta-love between both couples in this book seemed incredibly forced and unnecessary. The intimate scenes, while very brief, shouldn’t have existed at all, because they didn’t add any substance to their relationships or drive the plot in any way whatsoever. Both relationships are very surface level and seem immature. I found myself *feeling more* for the companions/friends in this book rather than the romance. <br /><br />Thank you to NetGalley for the ARC."

      "review": "In the last stretch of September, I read, quite erratically, through Faebound. I’d had my eye on this book for quite some time beforehand, maybe half a year, and when my friend suggested we read it I was all aboard. I was super excited, ready to fall into the world head first, yet I came away more disappointed, and confused than anything else. I was left with a feeling of “what just happened” and most important “what did I just read”? While I loved the setting of the book which was magical, well thought out, and had so much uniqueness tied into it, there were so many other factors that made this book a 2 star for me. Beware reading ahead as this review does include major spoilers.<br /><br /><br />The Passage of Time or Lackthereof!<br />\tGoing into the first few chapters, I was mesmerized by this world of elves, magic, and drumbeats producing said magic. I thought it was super cool, and it felt culturally rich, inclusive, and unique; this book was shaping up to be a five-star within only three or so chapters; and then came the odd pacing. We were thrust right into the book’s conflict, there was little to no build-up, and we didn’t really get to know anyone outside of Yeeran and her little sister Leetle, and barely that! This book at times seemed to be floating in a space of limbo where you couldn’t count on time itself. An example that comes to mind is when Furi (a main love interest) rides off on her obeah (a magical animal companion) and Yeeran (one of our main characters) wonders with her own Obeah Pila whether or not they’ll be able to ride the same way one day. It seems like only three or four chapters after this event they are riding the same way! <br />\tAs the book continues the pacing gets a bit looser, with everything seeming to happen too quickly once our main trio of elves gets to Mosima (a magical kingdom in the book). While this is where our story truly begins to lift off, there is still no steady handrail we can hold onto when it comes to the pacing of things. We’re never explicitly told the number of days, or weeks that pass and are simply expected to keep up with time by counting the amount of banquits or celebrations they have, which are many! Sometimes a time skip would be thrown in, but the reality was that most of our time skips were fade-to-black scenes that made me feel as if I was playing a video novel; putting my character to bed before the next chapter began. <br /> I’d like to speak more fully on this topic later on in my review but I’d also like to say here that due to the uneven pacing of the story (some moments happening too quickly, others too slowly), the romances in the book didn’t feel organic, true, or genuine! They were very hard to ship or to like. <br /><br /><br />- The Characters, but Most Importantly Yeeran!<br />\t<br />YEERAN<br /> When Yeeran first made it to the page, I believed I would like her. She came in as a powerful character with solid morals, a good head on her shoulders, and an interesting past. Then her sister told her about a prophecy given to her by gods that Yeeran herself doesn’t believe in, and chasing glory, she got 300 elves killed! Not only did this bother me because we had no warning that this kind of thirst for honor or glory existed in her, but also because it happened so suddenly (another example of bad pacing). We were led to believe that Yeeran was someone who saw war as her use in life, not her passion, but something she had to do to ensure that peace would come eventually to her tribe. She was built as a character who was very intelligent, especially in war and combat, and yet in the first action scene we get of her, she goes onto the battlefield and makes such a rookie mistake that she indirectly kills hundreds. <br />\tTo continue speaking of Yeeran, I’d like to speak on some aspects of her character that I didn’t enjoy so much. Throughout this book, from beginning nearly to end, Yeeran feels like the personification of the male gaze. It felt like every time she laid eyes on Furi, who would go on to be her main love interest, she was seeing her as a sexual being/object. We must also remember that Yeeran leaves a lover in her tribe, one whom we are led to believe that she loves deeply. Yet in the first few chapters, we get of Yeeren and Furi interacting, Yeeran is ogling her as if she only exists purely for physical gratification. At one point, Yeeran is forced to tamp down her arousal at having simply lain eyes on Furi! This all goes on before the two truly know one another and while hate is still brewing between them due to Yeeran’s indirect murder of Furi’s brother, and the fact that the Elves have been indirectly murdering Fae for YEARS. There is also a scene in the book where Yeeran is so busy leering at Furi that she doesn’t realize it’s Furi she’s leering at! I’m aware that sexual arousal and attraction exist between people, and it’s natural to be attracted to others. However, in the context of the book, it was extremely unrealistic for Yeeran to have reacted the way she did to Furi in those first few interactions, especially because as this was all happening, she was still pining for her lover who she’d been forced to leave behind! The relationship that blossomed between Yeeran and Furi did not feel like love, it felt like lust. The amount of times Furi is objectified by Yeeran whether it’s being ogled at or having the slits in her clothes pointed out whenever they’re present is ridiculous. <br />\tThroughout the book, we are told through Yeeran’s POV that the war effort is her entire life, and not only this but she’s deeply in love with the chieftain of her tribe, Salawa. However, despite this, she suddenly decides that she’s no longer in love with her after sleeping with Furi for a single time. Furi asks Yeeran to stay in Mosima forever and remain devoted to her as her consort and Yeeran agrees to this, tossing out all of the things she’s ever wanted or lived for, for YEARS of her life. This would be okay if we got even a single introspective scene where she thinks through the consequences of this choice or even a slow culmination of her love for Salawa waning, but we never do. We are supposed to accept that Furi is the new love interest and be happy with the result, and we’re not!<br /><br />LEETLE<br /> Leetle’s character is the one who makes the most sense, and yet even her characterization falls flat like a house of cards. Leetle, the little sister of Yeeran leaves the tribe in search of Yeeran. She wants to bring her sister back home because she is the only family she has left. This makes sense, what doesn’t make sense is her crippling desire to go back home once they find themselves in Mosima. In the beginning, it makes sense for her to want to go back home, she is in a strange land where people do not accept her for who she is. Yet, towards the end of the book, it looks like she’ll have a life, career, and way to reconnect back to her beliefs in Mosima. Yet, she still wants to go home, to a tribe who lives a life she doesn’t agree with and to a place where she won’t be able to continue being a seer, due to the magic being dependent on killing Obeah, which she is now against. <br />\tDespite Leetle being 28 years old, she doesn’t act her age. She acts like she’s 17, very childish and experienceless. At one point in the book she expresses jealousy towards her sister since her sister has had many admirers and lovers, and she in turn has not despite being very beautiful and curvaceous. This bout of jealousy is brought on by her false belief that Rayan (our third protagonist) is in love with Yeeran. She showcases this same jealous streak throughout the book. I would also like to state here that NONE of the characters act their age! I was under the impression that they were all in their late teens or very early twenties. When I found out they were in their late 20’s and early 30’s I was in shock!<br /> Leetle’s relationship with Rayan also comes off as lust rather than love (because we needed more than one rushed relationship), which falls flat similarly to Leetle’s personality. When we meet the two they’re traveling together in search of Yeeran who they seem to find after only a week, and by this point, they’re already in “love”. They only grow more in love while in Mosima even though Rayan is a soldier, and Leetle hates soldiers but for some odd reason, his being a soldier isn’t all that bad. This all culminates in Lettle deciding to stay in Mosima when it is revealed that Rayan is the next king and he asks her to stay on as his consort. So her desire to be in a place away from the forever war didn’t convince her to stay, her ability to train under a seer didn’t convince her to stay, and her ability to be a seer and practice her magic couldn’t convince her to stay, but Rayan asking her to stay, after a month or so of falling in love, convinces her to stay! <br /><br />RAYAN <br />\tThere isn’t much I can say about Rayan, and that’s his biggest flaw. He felt like a plot device rather than a character. He doesn’t get much page time, and when he does it’s usually with Leetle. He doesn’t have a POV, we don’t get to see what he’s doing in his spare time, and we get very little story and background on him although he plays such a huge role later on in the book. I am convinced that Rayan was thrown into the plot way later to give Leetle a love story, and to provide a shock factor towards the end of the book. It felt like he was written in at the end of the book!<br />\tWe must also talk about how he is somehow immune from the general prejudice that is thrown towards Elves. I guess one could call this an easter egg to his true heritage but for the entire book, I was so confused as to why it seemed he was more accepted than Leetle or even Yeeran. Here was Yeeran who had openly and publicly become fae-bound, here was Leetle who had no part in the forever war, or mass slaughtering of Obeah, and then there was Rayan, who not only had a direct hand in slaughtering Obeah but was also a warrior like Yeeran. Yet it seems he fits in more than Yeeran and Leetle. <br /><br />PILA<br />\tPila, Pila, Pila, the character in this book that I liked the most, and she is given the least bit of justice and autonomy. Pila is the bonded Obeah to Yeeran, and from the beginning of this bonding process, I felt like Pila was much the same as Rayan, a plot device. Used to make Yeeran more familiar to the Fae, and to make her stand out from her sister and Rayan. This eventually falls through because Rayan is revealed to have true Fae heritage and be king of Mosima. So now we have a character on the side, used as a device to warm and tie Yeeran to Mosima, and to make her stand out, and it only really succeeds at the former. <br />\tPila comes off as a child, despite saying in the beginning, when she is first introduced to Yeeran that she has been waiting for years. She also seems not to have the same amount of autonomy as Yeeran herself in the bond they share. We are told that when a Fae, or in this case an Elf, bonds to an Obeah their spirits combine and become one. The obeah is the fae, and the fae is the obeah. However, throughout the book, we see Yeeran make decisions that are best for her and beneficial to… no one else. Yeeran decides she is going back home, to the same lands where obeahs are slaughtered en masse for their skin to make magical drums and weapons for the “forever” war. Pila never goes against this idea, and simply is content with going back with her. Yeeran doesn’t even make it clear that she doesn’t expect Pila to follow her until the very end of the book. <br />\tPila seems to go against all of what we learn about Obeah before she is introduced. They appear to be intelligent, classified as Fae themselves. Yet when asked, Pila tells Yeeran that she was simply a beast before they bonded. Does this mean that Obeah aren’t truly intelligent until they become fae-bound? Does this mean that their intelligence and ability to communicate is taken from the fae they bond to, similarly to how their magic is taken on by the fae after the bond? We never receive the answers to these questions. <br /> Pila seems more mindless, prone to wandering off within her mind and spitting random bits of sage advice and wisdom at the most awkward times. She seemed like perhaps she was the first Obeah to ever become Faebound. <br /><br />FURI<br />\tFuri, like her namesake infuriated me. She was petty, angry, conniving, vengeful, and honestly, she had every single right to be. Face to face with the woman who’d killed her brother, she reacted how any person would react, with anger. What I didn’t expect was for her to fall in love with Yeeran only a month or so after bringing her to Mosima as a prisoner. And all Yeeran had to do for the honor of becoming Furi’s trusted consort in a land where her kind are hated for their unjust killing of Obeah was pick fruits for a few weeks. This was what they bonded over, this is what pushed them from enemies to slight friends, and thus to lovers. Yet the author does show us that this sudden relationship was strenuous. When the queens die, she immediately blames Leetle, who is defended by her big sister Yeeran. It is made clear that her prejudices against Elves remain intact and the only thing protecting Yeeran from this same fire is the fact that they’re sleeping together. How we hop from accusing her little sister of the murder of her mother to asking Yeeran to stay in an unfamiliar land forever as her official consort, was beyond me, as I’m sure it was beyond many other readers. <br />\tI’d also like to ask why Furi and by extension, her mother, aunt, and cousin didn’t feel more protective of Pila. It seemed that after the bonding there was no need to protect Pila, to make sure that she was doing well in the grasp of this big, scary Elf who had slaughtered and skinned Pila’s kind. Is this because the Fae are fully aware that once an obeah and a Fae (or elf) become fae-bound, nothing can reverse this? Is it because they truly uphold the bond between a person and their obeah, to the point where they simply assume the obeah will be safe? If so, we never see this discussion being had, these prejudices hurled, or these assumptions being quieted or brought up. They watch an an Obeah, a greatly respected and prized animal bonded to an elf, a people the Fae see as savage and cruel and no one seems to think about Pila’s well-being, this is odd. <br />\tGoing back to Furi and Yeeran’s relationship, I would like to add one more detail on that front. In the book, there is a scene where the two are lying together. Furi spots the slit in Yeeran’s ear, a punishment she was bestowed when she was banished from her tribe for getting 300 elves killed. Furi then says that she’d kill the person who did it to Yeeran. How do we get to this? How do we get a member who is part of a society where they highly value life (they don’t even eat meat) saying that they will kill a person for harming the very same person who they hated only weeks prior? <br /><br />THE QUEENS<br />\tAll I have to say is this. <br />\t\"Here, angry, then gone.\" - A good friend<br /><br /><br />Lasting Notes <br />\tFaebound, while enjoyable for its cultural aspects, queer-normative world, and sense of magical whimsy, was still an amalgamation of bad characterization, an unmoving plot motivated by rushed romantic encounters, and characters who seemed to forget who they were all of the time. Add in characters who seemed half-baked, and thrown into the plot to move the story forward for other more central characters and you have Faebound. I desperately wanted to like this book as I’d had my eyes on it for months before I finally sat down to read it, and yet it disappointed me. Maybe with more of a focus on solidifying who the characters were at their core, who they wanted to be, and what their motivations were, it could’ve been a better story. The author also could’ve afforded to flesh out the romantic aspects of the novel. I’m aware that this will be a trilogy, so the romances we saw could’ve truly blossomed in the second book. I initially rated the book a 2.5 but have since dropped my rating to a 2, and decided that I will not continue the series. Thank you all for reading my fellow muses, and onto the next book!"

The world building was 5/5 stars for me! I think the lore and magic system are very interesting. I like the integration of the different magic systems and the prophecy aspect.

The concept is 5 stars, the idea that we meet and interact with REAL adults? 2000 stars. BIPOC and LGBTQIA representation 5000 stars. There are nonbinary characters who we meet and it is truly no big deal they are nonbinary. They are introduced and just are a part of the story with no preamble or second consideration for their orientation or gender identity, which was really refreshing. Just living their lives as who they are - really nice to read and such great representation. <br /><br />The reality, for me, though is the characters are adult in age only - the author wrote them to act and make very, very juvenile decisions. Very juvenile dialogue. Juvenile politics. So much so that it was hard to take seriously sometimes.<br /><br />And don't get me started on the Audible narrator and her atrocious, truly and epically bad performance. Negative 11 million stars. She ruined what little positive the book had going for it. It. Was. So. Bad. If they hire her for the next installment, they are insane. I've listened to hundreds of audiobooks and this was without the absolute worst I've ever experienced by a LONG measure. Her voices and inflections were really difficult to listen to. I had such a negative experience that I'm now wary of listening to anything she narrates. <br /><br />So why 3 stars? I tried very hard to consider \"what if I had just read this book and wasn't swayed by the narrator?\" and landed on 2.75 rounded up because there are some really interesting things happening on the pages. <br /><br />The way the races (elves and fae) interact is interesting. The history the author is trying to build is interesting. The big reveals? Not so interesting and pretty predictable but still kept me going. <br /><br />Will I read the next book? Maybe... I'm curious enough that I just might. If they pick the same narrator I will NOT listen though. If I'm being honest, the people who produced the audio book should be ashamed of what they published. It does the book a disservice. Her voices for the characters are so ridiculous and her expression of the word made it sound like I was listening to 12 year olds instead of 30-somethings. I know Bahni Turpin has narrated many, many books -and I now want to listen to none of them. A bad director maybe? I don't know... It was just so, so bad."

      "review": "This book had an intriguing premise, but ultimately, it didn't live up to its potential. The story was marred by a romance that felt rushed and misplaced, and characters who were inexplicably quick to fall in love. Their intense attraction, particularly in situations where it seemed inappropriate or downright unrealistic, made it difficult for me to stay invested in their relationships.<br /><br />The plot, while promising, suffered from a lack of polish. Certain sections desperately needed more descriptive writing to fully immerse the reader in the world, while others could have benefited from a stronger editorial hand. There were moments where I found myself scratching my head, especially when the characters, who are supposed to be prisoners, trusted others without hesitation. This lack of skepticism seemed out of place given their circumstances.<br /><br />The dialogue was another weak point. It often felt awkward and unnatural, with characters speaking in ways that didn't feel authentic or believable. This made it hard to connect with them and detracted from the overall reading experience. Emotional moments that should have packed a punch, or significant plot reveals that should have left me in awe, instead fell flat due to poor execution.<br /><br />One of the more unique elements of the book, the concept of the \"obeah\"—a blend of connected dragons reminiscent of *Eragon* and daemons from *His Dark Materials*—had the potential to be a standout feature. However, it too lacked the necessary depth and development to fully engage me. <br /><br />Additionally, the characters' intelligence, or lack thereof, was frustrating. Given their high-ranking positions in the military, I expected them to be more perceptive and less naive. For instance, the identity of Chieftain Akimodo, which should have been a significant revelation, was glaringly obvious from the start. This made it hard to believe in the characters' competence and diminished the story's suspense. <br /><br />That said, I hugely enjoyed the homonormative elements of the book. The representation of same-sex relationships as normal and accepted within the story's world was refreshing and empowering. It was woven into the narrative in a way that felt natural and integral to the characters' lives, adding a layer of depth and inclusivity that I really appreciated. This aspect of the book was a definite highlight and made the story more engaging and relatable.<br /><br /><br />Overall, while the book had some interesting ideas, it fell short in execution. The rushed romance, awkward dialogue, and lack of depth in both the plot and character development made for a frustrating reading experience. With more careful editing and attention to detail, this could have been a much stronger and more enjoyable story. Plus, the marketing of the book should be different. I expected a high fantasy novel but ended up with a mid romantasy book 🤷🏻‍♀️"

      "review": "ARC Review: Publish Date 1/24/2024<br />Thank you Net Galley for letting me read more books!<br /><br />This is a highly anticipated upcoming release that has some serious buzz so I was very excited to receive the ARC. <br /><br />3.5 stars<br /><br />What I liked: <br />The animal companions, the Sapphic spicy romance, the queer representation!, the magic system, the premise, the Afro-Indian inspired world and lore, the rivals to lovers romance, the war and political drama. <br /><br />What I didn't like: <br />The magic system was never fully explained and left me with questions on how everything worked. The magic of divination / prophesy is one of the main magical components, but all the prophesies were fairly straightforward and easy to \"solve\", but our mains didn't figure out any of them until they happened so it was frustrating to read, knowing what was coming, and waiting for them to to catch up. I felt like I was screaming at the characters to get it! I didn't feel super connected to the characters unfortunately, especially Lettle, there just wasn't a lot of depth to them. Lettle's romance felt forced and weird, with insta-love, but not a lot of chemistry and hardly any real interaction. There wasn't a ton of depth to the characters and the story felt romance first, plot second. Also the pacing was very slow for most of the story and the writing sometimes was repetitive. And the war / political drama that I thought I was going to be heavily involved in based on the first several chapters, very quickly drops away and takes a back burner. <br /><br />Overall, this was a pretty good romantasy. I think maybe my expectations were very high, and that made me feel more let down than I typically would. The setup and ending of book one, makes me want to continue into book two because it ends on a \"what's going to happen next\", and I like the world and characters enough to stay with them. I would recommend this to romantasy readers, especially for the representation and rich world. Definitely has the potential to grow into an amazing series. <br />"

      "review": "Thank you to NetGalley and the publisher for providing the eARC for me to read before release!<br /><br />Stories of the gods and elvish prophecies drive this book.<br /><br />We follow the stories of Yeeran, an elvish colonel, and Lettle, her diviner sister, This begins as a very military fantasy, as we follow Yeeran through her first day as colonel of the Waning army during the Forever War. She's given a prophecy by her sister, and in following it, she gets herself exiled.<br /><br />Not wanting to be apart from her, Lettle and Yeeran's captain Rayan follow her into exile. What they don't expect is to encounter fae, who are just a part of their fairytales as far as most elves are concerned. They're then drawn into the fae world and their lives are turned upside down.<br /><br />I did enjoy this book. The unique world building, the different magic system, and the different worlds and cultures was very interesting. I just wish everything had been explored a little more.<br /><br />I also really love the diverse cast of characters, the normalization of queer characters and different sexualities and viewpoints of relationships, and the representation of characters with disabilities that weren't limited by those things. The hetero and sapphic romances were a breath of fresh air, though often felt more lust driven than deeper. <br /><br />The story was rather slow in some parts, and that took me out of the book quite a bit. I really feel like the author was setting up for the next book in the series, and I hope that all this setup really shines through in the next book. I'm not sure if there were supposed to be big twists in this story, but to me it was all rather obvious how the prophesies would play out and how other events came to be.<br /><br />Overall, I'm very happy that I read this, and loved a lot of the elements. It just missed the mark for me in being a truly amazing book. I have full confidence though, that it will find it's perfect readers out there."

      "review": "Came for the promise of Sapphic romantasy, it delivered. <br /><br />This is not a dynamic genre-breaking hugo-nebula nominated fantasy, but that's okay! This is not going contain bold court politics or the devil you become during war or even the trauma of being beholden to your gods and Fates. <br /><br />It is a Romantasy, filled with kissing, yearning, mooning and if someone gets stabbed, if there is regicide, if there is the trauma of childhood starvation, then guess what I am more than excited to read each chapter. Its good to indulge, its good to have a happy good time between the grimdark, the experimental, the gritty and poetic. Its inclusive, it is Queer, it's a little sexy!<br /><br />Do not come here for Priory of the Orange Tree, Poppy War, Gideon the Ninth you will not be pleased. You will leave disappointed and annoyed and bamboozeled.<br /><br />Come here if you're queer and want to get into fantasy - then go buy a copy. Come here for the dangers, daggers, and prophecies. I spent my BART and Bus commutes riding along with Yeeren, Lettle, Rayan and Furi for a few mornings and nights, and it was just plain fun.<br /><br />If you want romance while learning battle magic and training montages. If you want sisters with Issues and actually feel like bickering siblings. If you want to feel utterly attacked by characters falling in love with Women In Power and you probably like how they hold power over you then, like me, seek therapy. After that, show the fuck up at the bookstore and support a Sapphic romantasy. I promise you'll giggle and kick your feet, lesbians and bisexual girlies deserve the fun romantasy rep.<br /><br />My Issues - mine.<br /><br />Clunky scene writing and interior character writing reminiscent of YA SFF. I expected it to be a bit more polished and less...modern Ala Fourth Wing. Once I got over this expectation I had a good time, but still a Con.<br /><br />Rushed ending and little expansion on exterior political culture, would have liked to settle into both worlds a little more, may see more expansion in the second installment (for which I will be sat).<br /><br />Oddly, I would have liked Furi's POV chapters, which is strange I rarely like multiple chapter POVs. I think the book would have benefitted from her interior and emotional drive, even if it would have given away certain plot elements and machinations. Which actually, may have been stronger plot-wise for us to be aware of certain facts even if the others were not.<br /><br />4.3/5 - solid enjoyable read I will recommend to the Queer girlies who stumble into my work and aren't ready to be crushed by the weight of Jasmine Throne, Priory of the Orange Tree or Gideon the Ninth."

(i also hope we get yuri povs like im sorry let me fall in love with her inner thoughts please and thank you)<br />&amp; i love that we got the gang’s journal entries at the end<br /><br />anyways the book ended really well to set up the next one and im gonna need it stat i read this in 2 days"

      "review": "I am devastated that I hated this book because it was one of my most highly anticipated reads of the year, and fairyloot delivered an absolutely stunning edition in the December box. I took a lot of notes while reading this book and most of them were rants that didn’t need to be published, although they were also quite entertaining to read back on so I might leave a few of my raw comments at the bottom of this post. <br />I entered this book with high expectations after reading rave reviews, and it ended up being genuinely one of the worst books I have ever read. <br />I did really enjoy the world and the magic system IN THEORY, but every single thing felt underdeveloped and it was giving nothing. I did really appreciate the mostly queer and poc cast of characters, however for every thing I liked, there were 5 I disliked. The characters who were supposed to be in their late 20’s to early 30’s and read like they were in their teens, with writing so pedestrian that it felt like reading YA. In what should have been incredibly high stakes situations I did not believe anything might go wrong for one minute. The main character spent the whole novel playing the victim, avoiding responsibility for what she had done, and then gaslighting the people around her into giving her what she wanted. This book was a prime example of an author telling and not showing and there was no real development in any of the relationships on the page. The breaking point for me was when someone referred to s*x as “doing the in and out”… jail. Immediately. This book should have stayed in the drafts fr<br /><br />Some of my unfiltered notes from my read:<br /><br />Tell me why this girl found out her sister was about to be executed and instead of doing anything useful she just screamed<br /><br />Babe your sister is in prison and you’re having a bath with a lad, talking about how confident you are in your body, and thinking about his pee pee like bro come onnnnn<br /><br />Why does this read like unedited fanfiction level of quality. Like people do not talk like that fr<br /><br />Where are the stakes. Give me some stakes. I just read someone nearly get executed and knew nothing bad would ever happen to them bc the stakes in this novel are SO LOW<br /><br />This 35 year old battle commander who has been in a magical war since she was like a teenager is just screaming into her pillow bc an animal is talking to her like be so fr right now you like in a magical world this is not the strangest thing to happen to you<br /><br />The fucking gall of this bitch to think she has any right to hate Furi after she LITERALLY KILLED HER BROTHER like fuck off and shut up<br /><br />The shield sister analogy on page 151 is the dumbest fucking paragraph I have ever read in my life<br /><br />How can a book that is this short be this boring like I am actually getting drowsy reading this shit <br /><br />Imagine being 28 big years old and still bringing up your sister missing your school graduation because she was literally at war. Like grow up you petty little shit <br /><br />“Yeeran had thought the liquid inside was blood. That was until she sipped it and recognised the sweet tartness of pomegranate juice” bitch why did you sip it if you THOUGHT IT WAS BLOOD<br /><br />Gets rejected one time by the girl he has no chemistry with (but obviously I’m supposed to believe in their love story) and so hooks up with one of the fae who are holding them captive… then shows up to the first girls door in the middle of the night to have a little cry about it. Grow up man <br /><br />The problem with trying to write a high fantasy with a large cast in under 400 pages is that I have literally no idea who any of these side characters are because nothing they do is memorable <br /><br />Yeeran is such a pick me choose me victim card character like bitch take a little responsibility for your actions and stop whinging that people don’t like you <br /><br />This whole book is just a guide to gaslighting your way into getting whatever you want. <br /><br />“My name is Queen Furi” no it isn’t, that’s just your title and also who says that?!<br /><br />I am just not convinced that these characters are so in love. This book is a prime example of telling and not showing. There has been no real development of this relationship and now it’s all “she loved Rayan. Deeply. Irrevocably.” Twilight had a more convincing romance than this<br /><br />An old man going to an event with two woman and saying “a threesome, my favourite” about it is the most disgusting and uncomfy I have felt through this whole read <br /><br />Every single sex scene in this book could have been left at just a kiss. Not one felt naturally placed or paced<br />"

      "review": "I don't even know how to start my review other than saying that I F-ing LOVED this book! I didn't know that this was marketed as a romantasy, I thought it was an adult fantasy book so I loved the little surprise that there is romance! I want to break down all the pieces of the books to my memory:<br /><br /><b>The world building is one of the best I've seen in a long time.</b> Right when you open the book, you get told of the ancient history and prophecy of this world. What many fantasy books struggle with is that these prophecies are either completely irrelevant or make no sense-but not this one. The world was what immediately sucked me in. A century-long war between elven tribes, the fae race that is believed to be a myth, and human race to be undiscovered too. The gods who created the elves, the fae, and the humans had such a unique story - this was definitely one of my favorite parts of the book.<b>This book has a super cool magic system!</b> Drum magic?! How cool is that! Plus we have the magic of the fae and seer capabilities in our characters. You can actually see magic and see the energy of the other people. I loved it! <br /><br /><b>This book has an extremely diverse cast of characters!</b> I think almost every single character in this book is BIPOC with a large majority of them being queer characters. I don't know if the original version of the book has it (I have the FairyLoot edition), but I loved that we had a guide to each character with their blurbs and pronouns. There is representation in many forms in this book which I found very cool! <br /><br /><b>Fae, Elves, and other mystical beings galore!</b> If you loved the telepathic relationships that we see in \"Fourth Wing\", the seductiveness of fae that we see in \"A Court of Thorns and Roses\", then you will definitely enjoy this book! The relationships with the fae and obeah were really cool! <br /><br /><b>A fantasy book with relevant social issues that is related to our real world today.</b> Also a list of possible TW'S: classism, hate crimes, racism, xenophobia, war, murder/violence/death of family members. <br /><br /><b>The plot was mid-paced, mid-stakes, and has some predicted twists and turns, but I was okay with it.</b> We have a two POV in this book between sisters - Yeeran and Lettle. Yeeran is an officer in the Waning Tribe who is fighting against the Celestial Tribe. Yeeran made a mistake during a battle that got her banished from their tribe. Lettle goes off to find her sister alongside Rayan - another ex-officer of the Waning Tribe. During their plans to find a way back to the Waning Tribe's graces, the three of them get captured by the fae. Then they are transported to the magical fae world , Mosimer, where they must find a way to escape. I see the criticisms of the plot being choppy and inconsistent, but I personally did not find that? I was fully entranced.<br /><br /><b>The romance was good - that is if you are okay with insta-love.</b> Or maybe I should call it insta-lust? There was not much emotional depth to the romantic relationships with these characters. But I've read MUCH worse insta-lust/love books before. When you have a rival to lovers plot, I think you need to make sure you put in extra effort for the emotional connection between the two people. I think that maybe having the first book be all build up and the second book having the steamy scenes would've been better. I personally felt that the romance was quite light in this book, the plot was more focal. <br /><br />Overall - I really enjoyed this! I am giving 4.5 stars, and rounding up to 5 for GR. "

      "review": "3.25 ⭐️<br /><br />I was very excited about this book after the hype around it, and while there are parts I really enjoyed, it didn’t feel like it fully lived up to my expectations.<br /><br />Positives first, I loved the world building that was shown. I really liked the small amounts of development of the war as well as the city they were locked into later on. I wish we had gotten more development of either of them, but I’m not incredibly disappointed that it wasn’t more expanded upon in the first book as I expect with the developments of the end of it, it’ll be better explored in book two.<br />I also really liked the idea of drums being used as a conduit for Yeeran’s magic. It was really interesting, especially in the context of using it for battle. The prophecy magic felt less compelling since it doesn’t have that much of a direct effect on the story, but I do feel like it’s been set up to be more intergrated in the next book so I am excited to see how that develops. More than anything, I think this book’s strength is its world building and the bits of plot that it’s set up for the next book.<br />I loved the inclusion of how queer normative both societies were in general. And I also loved the inclusion of Leetle’s disability, and the tools and accommodations she uses throughout the book to work with it. <br /><br />Unfortunately, this is a romantasy book though, so its focus is in its relationships, both platonic and especially romantic. Which I didn’t love. Leetle’s romance with Rayan felt incredibly insta love, and that it relied on tropes more than real development of their relationship. In fact, a lot of the initial interactions they have that build the romance happen off page in the time they’re travelling to find Yerran, so when we get to an only one bed scene, it feels toothless, since there’s no build up tension to make it work. It feels like it’s only there to make the reader excited because they said the words only one bed. Because of the lack of the lack of buildup to their romance, the decisions and feelings Lettle has in regard to it feel weird and out of place. <br />There is a scene where she is in incredible danger, and could be executed for a misstep, and in that moment she suddenly realizes she’s in love with Rayan, and is suddenly grinning at the worst possible time, it feels so out of place, and it makes her as a character feel more like a teenager with her first crush then a nearly 30 year old woman. <br /><br />Yeeran and Furi’s relationship is slightly better, if only because the enemies to lovers aspect of it allows for more tension and development to happen before the romance fully happens. But even still, the snap from hate to romance, and the who did this to you trope, is so quick it lacks any of the emotional depth it needs for that trope to really hook me. I do wish to see more of them in the next book, and I think their relationship is the more interesting one to explore, but it still felt rushed, like the author was trying to have the relationships established before jumping into the plot in the next books, and I wish we got a longer development to both romances.<br /><br />Yeeran and Lettle’s relationship as sisters felt like it had the most potential of all the interactions but it still felt slightly underdeveloped. For example, Leetle has multiple thoughts where she deliberately sets Yeeran’s objectives as being a soldier as separate to every other soldier in the war (and this later includes Rayan as she develops feelings for him) where she sees her as well intentioned but misguided, while seeing every other soldier in the war as power/war hungry. I wish we saw more of this black and white good and bad thinking being interrogated and even used in interactions between the sisters, because it felt like that thought process was so deliberately spelled out for the reader, but it feels like it was just introduced and then dropped, with Lettle never being pushed to really question that line of thinking. I just wish in general, the bits of love and tension between their personalities were more developed for the first book. <br /><br />I do plan on continuing the series, and hopefully it will address some of the issues that I had with the first book’s setup. But overall this felt like a decent, if a little rushed in its développement, first instalment and setup for a new series. <br />"

      "review": "This book had so much potential but just fell flat, a theme I am finding with so many fantasy books lately. <br /><br />The world building has potential, isn’t fully thought through and left me with so many questions. What landscape do the elves live in? I thought it was desert landscape which would at least explain the desire for the fraedia crystals, but when Yeeran is exiled she’s left in a rainforest? There’s no explanation for the differences in the elf tribes or why they’ve been at war forever. Their judicial system is also questionable. A lot of the writing felt half thought through and done for simple convenience rather than purpose.<br /><br />The characters had no arc, Lettle read as a bratty teen who always wanted her way and would tantrum if she didn’t get it. Yeeran seems to fall in love (lust) with the women who’s brother she just murdered instantly, there was barely time for these two to be enemies before Yeeran was making moon eyes as her and being jealous of everyone Furi had slept with. And Rayan was about as deep as a teaspoon.<br /><br />All romance fell flat with these characters I wasn’t rooting for anyone to get together, just for the book to end faster. I can appreciate the book’s acceptance of non-binary folk, and queer relationships, but honestly, it felt like a box to tick to be counted as inclusion. While many of the main characters were queer and was something that initially drew me to this book, there was no cultural explanation of how both of these societies who have lived so separate from each other for so long came to the exact same level of acceptance as each other when it comes to gender politics. <br /><br />The magic system is also confusing. There is no reason currently given as to why Yeeran is able to be faebonded, and no real explanation of how the magic of the obeah is not lost when it dies, because otherwise why was there not a bigger deal made in Mosima when a fae and Obeah die if there is so much magic remaining in these creatures. Also I still don’t know what they look like, I’m imagining black lions with antlers but if they have teeth and claws there is no evolutionary explanation for them to need antlers as well, or none that is given anyway. <br /><br />Overall I felt that this book had a lot of plot holes that may be filled further in the series but does not engage the reader enough for them to desire to read on. With plenty of potential but none of the follow through, I would not recommend this book to anyone looking for a new fantasy book or an interesting romance."

      "review": "After reading The Final Strife i wasn't a huge fan of this author but since I quite liked the writing style more than the story, i thought I would give her another go. The blurb was interesting enough and of course who doesn't want some Black fae. Can i get an amen!<br /><br />The premise of this is that an elf is forced into exile and stumbles upon some fae who are believed to have been extinct for thousands of years. Where I had trouble with this is that from the offset there were no real stakes. Yeeran the elf (yes there are elves in this book as well as fae and human but don’t ask me how they differ other than elongated canines) is sent into exile for reasons but within the span of what feels like five minutes, her sister finds her to help her and she’s derived a plan that will allow her to return from exile. If it’s so easy to get back in then why is it ever considered a punishment?<br /><br />The entire book is full of this weak lines of plot and lack of stakes since everything is so perfectly resolved. At no point was i in fear for any of the characters or wondering what they would do next. It was all very predictable and frankly very immature considering the characters range from their late 20s to early 40s. While the writing made this an easy read thankfully, there was a lot to be desired by way of action, stakes, romance or drama.<br />The best part of the whole thing were the animal side kicks who were really sweet.<br />The smut while okay was also highly unnecessary. It felt rushed and forced with both scenes appearing in quick succession as though the author wanted to get it out the way.<br /><br />In a word, this book felt very childish and I was disappointed because i feel like the author is capable of so much more. It feels like she wrote to trend to meet a quota but that her heart wasnt actually in the content.<br /><br />The best thing about the whole book was the diversity and inclusion. There are a ton of Queer and Gender Neutral characters which was very inclusive and positive."

      "review": "Thank you to Netgalley and the publisher for a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.<br /><br />My Selling Pitch: <br />Avatar but this time they're riding the cats instead of *riding* the cats. <br /><br />On my do not read list<br /><br />Pre-reading:<br />No thoughts. Head empty. The blue Fairyloot edition is very pretty. My friend read this and said it was very meh, and I trust her opinion, so I've been putting this off but like maybe it’ll be okay?<br /><br />Thick of it:<br />Only reading this god‘s name as bosom. <br /><br />Imagine wanting kids. <br /><br />Bat boy origin story for the fae fucking confirmed. Get Sarah out of here. <br /><br />You’re telling me I have to read about two different species of pointed-ear fucks in this book? (On this episode of Samantha just opens books.)<br /><br />Yeeran. As in ye ran? Oh christ. <br /><br />Soldiers giving birth on the battle line is common? Be so forreal right now. What in the epidural are they taking that they’re going around swinging swords with gaping crevices?<br /><br />Maybe you don’t have enough soldiers because they’re too busy lugging around pieces of wood as your maps. What do you mean? <br /><br />This is so clunky already. DNF <br /><br />She doesn’t like to be interrupted and she talks slow? My absolute nightmare. <br /><br />This isn’t even a sex scene and already we’re getting turn-by-turn instructions for inserting tab A into slot B. It’s not vivid imagery to track their hands like this. It’s just bad writing. <br /><br />Wow, it sounds like her army will not be there in the morning. <br /><br />The city of guuuurl. <br /><br />Is this the drum equivalent of catgut strings lol?<br /><br />That doesn’t rhyme?<br /><br />Oh wow, right in on the child soldiers. <br /><br />The book: our people are starving<br />Also the book: we planted inedible flowers as ye olde Febreze because stinky dead bodies are like way more of a pressing issue<br />What do you mean.<br />Who published this? I wanna talk.<br /><br />Credit where credit is due- I have never seen a book use drums in place of guns, but like also what the fuck. <br /><br />So if they’re capable of making paper to make letters, why are we carrying around slabs of wood as our battlefield maps? <br /><br />Lgbtq+ elves<br /><br />If these critters are so valuable, why aren’t they breeding them? <br /><br />Def aesthetic uniforms, but there's no way those are practical in battle<br /><br />OK, disability rep. I see you. <br /><br />I think it’s interesting that the book keeps having a blue aesthetic, but then the original cover is red. The Fairyloot special edition is blue, and it seems like it fits the story way better. <br /><br />It’s such awkward, passive voice writing. <br /><br />I assume her sister is the waning moon, and she’s going to turn against her tribe because they’re murdering the fae or some shit?<br /><br />Oh there! So they’re like fucking pandas. They won’t breed in captivity. <br /><br />How does a captain of the army not know basic battlefield first aid?<br /><br />Oh my god, guys, they have the same favorite book. Do you think they’ll fall in love? I hate it here. <br /><br />Oh, I’m glad a concussion can heal in an hour. <br /><br />I can't not think of Hunger Games when people drink from trees. <br /><br />Goodness, this is insta lovey and heavy-handed with the romance. <br /><br />Nah, it's gonna be one bed. But like it’s so soon for that!<br /><br />Okay acotar lol<br /><br />A deep cut, but I’m just picturing them as mweors.<br /><br />Anyone else just picturing Furiosa? Like I know I’m wrong, but same vibe, same girl crush. <br /><br />And title drop<br /><br />The author: Look, audience, I thought about world-building!<br />The audience: oh cool, what’s the answer?<br />The author: Psh, I said, I thought about it. I didn’t say I figured out any answers.<br /><br />Book is very #fashion lol. <br /><br />It reminds me of Avatar.<br /><br />I mean, like obviously a cat is going to bind her so that they have to stop the execution. <br /><br />Very Fourth Wing<br /><br />Lol they follow a sun diet? Like that crazy vegan couple that starved their baby to death. <br /><br />This romance is so forced. It’s funny because it’s hitting things that would normally work in books, but it’s just not working. <br /><br />OK, so the queens are definitely gonna die and that glass staircase is definitely gonna break. <br /><br />God, I’m so bored. I wish I DNFed books. <br /><br />Why is the cat so willing to turn traitor on her whole family and species? <br /><br />I assume Komi is the two-bladed tyrant guy. <br /><br />I'm so boreddddd<br /><br />So like the not!Cinna is definitely fucking the prince, right?<br /><br />A simple mistake? She got 350 people killed, girlypop. <br /><br />Lmao Crescent City’s otter mail, but it’s just bush babies. <br /><br />This book’s pacing sucks. <br /><br />YOU KILLED HER BROTHER, GIRL. <br /><br />Not the G spot sin. <br /><br />This is such a bad sex scene. <br /><br />No one has chemistry. The politics of this world don’t work. The plot sucks. This is unreadable.<br /><br />These prophecies are really deus ex machina. Oh, there’s a plot hole? Shove a prophecy in it. <br /><br />Dude, what the fuck is this dialogue? Hey, sex was great. And he’s like it was, wasn’t it? Fucking what is that? <br /><br />Oh my god, I do not need another sex scene. <br /><br />Not the cadence of her movements. Who fucking wrote this?<br /><br />Is this gonna be a goddamn series? Cause it’s really shaping up to be, and I am not reading a second book. (Oh yes.)<br /><br />I’m just saying if you crank this audiobook to 2.5 times speed because you’re trying to get through it because you are hate reading at this point, the main character’s name sounds like urine. <br /><br />Good god, how much more is left? All they have to do is figure out that Komi is the tyrant, free themselves from fairyland, and other girlypop needs to realize that she has a cat protecting her too. I think killing her boyfriend will wait until book two or like the end of this one to end on a cliffhanger. <br /><br />And like the fashion designer (Golan) is like definitely fucking the prince brother (Nerad) that I literally have not written down his name in my book notes because he’s so irrelevant to the plot. <br /><br />Literally, I’m so bored. This book is so fucking predictable. <br /><br />It’s so Fourth Wing with the cringe bonded animals. <br /><br />I will give the book that I did not think this man was going to be relevant for anything more than his dick. <br /><br />If I had been paying attention to this book, I would be so pissed that they were spoon-feeding me the plot right now, but seeing as how I have cranked and suffered through it, I’m a little grateful because it makes taking summary notes real easy. <br /><br />Wow, I don’t need a third sex scene. <br /><br />Guys, they’re like on a beach. Imagine the sand in all the nooks and crannies. <br /><br />Not to be a germaphobe, but all these fantasy stories stories really freak me out when they’ll just be like exploring and fighting people and then they’re like time to finger blast each other. Like can you wash your hands? Like you know there’s dirt under those nails.<br /><br />I feel like the prince is responsible for killing the queens and he used his boyfriend’s tattoo ink to do it, but like Komi is still definitely the tyrant guy. (I nailed this book.)<br /><br />Literally, I’m so bored. I have predicted everything.<br /><br />Take a shot every time this book says cadence. <br /><br />I don’t think that’s what you do for a collapsed lung, but go off, bestie.<br /><br />No body, no death.<br /><br />Hey hey, cool motive, still murder. I don’t think murdering the queens was the right move there, my dude. <br /><br />Well, they solved literally nothing. So glad I suffered through all of that to get literally nowhere in the plot. I did it. Thank fuck. <br /><br />Post-reading:<br />Hated absolutely every second of this. <br /><br />The plot’s generic and has been done before. It's predictable as shit. It's repetitive. The pacing sucks. The dialogue is stilted and awkward. The writing itself veers into passive voice way too much. The prophecies function as get-out-of-jail-free cards for the book’s plot holes and feel cheaty and deus ex machina rather than carefully plotted. <br /><br />The romances feel forced. They hit all the cliche beats that normally work in fantasy romances, but this is what happens when you have a checklist of tropes to include and never focus on actual chemistry or banter. It all feels like instalove just because everyone is sooo hot. The sex scenes feel unnecessary and alienating because your audience is not invested in the romances. The scenes themselves read very insert tab an and into slot b. The book purports the idea that there’s a super special ridge inside vaginas that you can just press and have instant orgasms. Fuck right off. And then you’re also just throwing in unnecessary orgies and nudity for what? For vibes?<br /><br />The companion animals are cringey. The plot doesn't make a ton of sense. Why is the cat-and you bet your ass I’m calling them cats in this fantasy meow mix clusterfuck of a novel-so willing to turn on its own to help this random ass girl that just showed up? The politics of the world make no sense. There is nothing stopping people from murdering the line of succession. The story’s war hinges on some sun crystals, but it’s not like the sun doesn’t exist in this world? Why are people starving? If they need better land to grow crops, a sun crystal isn’t exactly gonna fix that problem. And it’s not like the land won’t grow crops because the land works well enough to grow flowers to cover the stench of dead bodies because somehow that’s a priority. There’s no world-building. We know nothing about where these people live or how except that they’re cool with the LGBTQ. <br /><br />This book is marketed as adult but aside from the sex scenes and child soldiers, there’s nothing adult about this. Those could be removed, and this could’ve been marketed as YA which would make a lot more sense because the characters read like teenagers even though they’re in their 30s. <br /><br />I also just really disliked the main character. She kills 350 people for following her sister‘s prophecy on a whim and shows no remorse for it and then she kills her love interest’s brother, but we’re supposed to just brush that off because she knows more now? Please.<br /><br />Don’t waste your time. Read literally anything else. <br /><br />Who should read this:<br />No one?<br />Generic fantasy romance girlies<br /><br />Do I want to reread this:<br />Fuck no. <br /><br />Similar books:<br />* Fourth Wing by Rebecca Yarros- fantasy romance, cringe animal companions<br />* Jasad Heir by Sara Hashem-actual enemies to lovers fantasy romance,<br />* Sun of Blood and Ruin by Mariely Lares-generic historical fantasy romance, enemies to lovers, secret magical heritage<br />* Dance of Thieves by Mary E.

      "review": "I wanted to love this book but it was just fine.<br /><br />The premise and the world-building are so good. The magic in this is really unique and it’s one of my favorite aspects of the book. The representation is a big plus too. There is a wide array of sexual identities, gender expressions, and disabilities on display, unapologetically. <br /><br />Sadly, the plot didn’t captivate me. While I was reading, I kept waiting for something else to happen. Something wild and world-shattering. But..that..didn’t..happen. I was bored a lot while reading this, not gonna lie.<br /><br />Yeeran and Lettle also annoyed me a lot. But it was mostly Lettle. She constantly acted childish and her tantrums irked the hell out of me. She’s almost 30 and you would think she���s a teenager based on how juvenile she acts. <br /><br />I also predicted a lot, like the prophesies, and the identity of some mysterious characters. Because of this, I didn’t feel like I was on this journey with the main characters. I wanted to be caught off guard by stuff, along with these characters but things were so obvious. <br /><br />This book is described as a romantic fantasy, but it’s not romance-heavy at all to me. With a romantasy, I expect the romantic relationships to be a main part of the plot. But that’s not the case with this book, they’re more like subplots in this. I didn’t mind Lettle’s relationship, I was fine. But Yeeran’s relationship didn’t feel developed enough. I understand the attraction, but when they got together, I wasn’t convinced because it happened way too fast. <br /><br />This wasn’t a bad book, I was just underwhelmed. 3⭐️<br />"

      "review": "Based on the blurb I thought I was going to love this book, but the story didn't match up, and it was a lot more predictable than I would have liked. A Story of Warring tribes, Elves, Fae, sapphic romance, banishment and mystery, there was a lot in this book that could have been amazing but I think it just fell short unfortunately. <br /><br />I read this for a book club which I think is the only reason I read it in the time I did, by about halfway through I wasn't reaching for it as much as I just wanted to have it finished for the discussion. <br /><br />The author basically spoon-feeds information quite early on in the story about the ending and the reveals later on, so it didn't feel like there was any mystery at all in this, and you have to wait till about 75% of the way through before things start to kick off, so the story is quite slow and not very engaging. I found myself getting annoyed that the characters hadn't figured out a few things especially when it was so glaringly obvious to the reader. Even when things were revealed through Lettle's prophecy, it was then more frustrating if it was misinterpreted. I ended up correctly predicting all but one reveal. <br /><br />The worldbuilding in this is okay but I found it hard to envision where they actually were. It is described as a forest with fields and greenery everywhere but later on in the book there are mango trees? So is it more of a woodland forest or a rainforest or both? It's never really made clear, there could have been more detail on the surroundings, but we did get plenty of detail on what each character was wearing every single time they had an outfit change. <br /><br />The magic system was interesting and something new at least but it doesn't feel like we were given enough detail again, which is a shame. <br /><br />As for the characters, I didn't feel a pull to any of them. Yereen and Lettle being the two main POV's, a lot of the time we would read what happened through one's eyes and then go back and read it through the others, which felt unnecessary and repetitive, there wasn't always a lot of new information that was shared, especially considering how easy it was to figure out what was going to happen. <br />My favourite character was Pila, she was the most entertaining. <br /><br />I will say, in terms of representation this book excels, which is a plus, and it was nice to read a book where the main characters were older then 18. Looking back I feel like this was the filler book in a series, like we missed the first part of the story and this was book two where things aren't happening but something big is coming in the next book. I might read the next book when it comes out but I may need convincing. <br />"

      "review": "I decided to pick up this novel after hearing nothing but great things about it on TikTok. I’m also researching comp titles for my own work in progress, and this novel was said to include fae, fantasy, dual POV, prophecies, and romance. I couldn’t wait to explore the author’s unique take on their world and meet their characters. <br /><br />The novel opens with scenes of children preparing for war. Whether they are practicing in battle formations, or described going onto the battlefield to collect treasures from the dead, these first scenes really set the tone for the harsh realities our characters are forced to live in. While some of the descriptions can be graphic, there were also mentions of killing magical creatures and using their furs and organs for their magical properties. If you are squeamish, or just love all creatures (even fantasy ones) this might be something you’d need to skip.<br /><br />Our two main characters whose POV’s we follow are sisters: one is a soldier leading troops into battle, and the other has studied the art of prophecies. I appreciated having their narrative spaces to travel back and forth between, but they aren’t written in first person, and I did occasionally get confused about whose POV we were supposed to be in.<br /><br />The descriptive language this author used was the strongest part of the book. It was so stunning that there were times I found myself rereading sentences just so I could fully take in the poetic prose, and see how it was interwoven into the mundane. Descriptions of eyes, skin, plant life, and magic were lush and full of metaphors and similes. <br /><br />Unfortunately the writing was my favorite part of this novel. While I appreciated the diverse cast of characters, and respectfully crafted representation, despite the high stakes created throughout the novel I just didn’t care what happened to our characters. At one point they discover a secret and become trapped in a new location, and the entire rest of the novel is them trying to find a way out. Whether they managed to escape or stayed trapped forever didn’t matter to me. <br /><br />I wasn’t drawn into the story or the fantasy/magical elements enough to hold my interest. While I appreciated that the romantic elements included sapphic representation, the romance in the novel didn’t leave me rooting for any of the characters to end up together. As I was reading I kept trying to ask myself why I felt this way? What was I missing, or what could have been added to hold my attention? What could have made me more emotionally invested? <br /><br />After briefly skimming a few reviews it seems I’m not the only reader who felt this story was lacking…something. Though this appears to be the less popular take on this novel, and many people did seem to enjoy the writing and the world building overall. There were a few twists that might excite readers, but were things I had already seen coming well before they were revealed. Ultimately I’m happy I read this novel so that I could sit with the descriptive language for a few days, but the story overall fell a little flat for me. <br />"

      "review": "I DNF'd this book at 50%. I wouldn't usually give a review of a book that I haven't read in its entirety but in this case I think I can give some honest feedback and recommendations regardless. <br />I was intrigued by this book, mainly because I had read The Final Strife a while ago (by the same author). I was interested to see how she would approach a Fae story, which is very different from her previous book(s). <br /><br />The first thing that came to mind when reading this, was that it felt very similar to other books I had read in the past. The storyline reminded me of ACOTAR, although it wasn't as compelling. And I could see how the author had taken inspiration from other popular books - for example one character reminded me very much of Cinna from Hunger Games - and had the same role/personality/relationship to the main character. Almost a carbon copy of the character, in fact. <br /><br />I liked that there was such prevalent Disability, LGBTQ and non-binary representation. This seems to be where this author is able to show strength. I also liked that there was Sapphic, Achillian and heterosexual love interests/romantic sub-plots too. Usually books tend to focus on just one of these so I liked the diversity here. <br /><br />However, what I read did seem to be very heavily tropey. And the tropes weren't written particularly well either. For example, we see the popular \"one bed\" trope in something like the third chapter? Almost like the author was trying to include it just to tick a box. I felt that it was too early to include that trope, particularly as there didn't seem to be any tension build up between the two characters prior to that point either. <br />Some other tropes include: Exile, enemies to lovers, friends to lovers, one bed as I have already mentioned, war, and \"trained by the enemy\" - most of these that we have seen before time and time again (and in my opinion, done much better than this attempt!) There didn't seem to be anything original or interesting here. <br />Overall though, my main reason for DNFing this book was because I found it very slow and boring. There seemed to be a lot of filler - things that weren't really relevant to the story or didn't move the story along. At 50% in, you would expect something significant to have happened, but each chapter was just very underwhelming. <br /><br />In terms of recommending this book - obviously it wasn't to my tastes, but if you like any of the tropes I have mentioned, or if you have enjoyed this Author's previous books, then I think you will enjoy this one too.<br />I have only put the 2 star rating in order to add this review.

      "review": "*gifted arc*<br /><br />These characters were so nuanced, real, and lovable. The sister bond was heartwarming. Love seeing a Black cast of characters, different gender expressions, queer and trans characters, and a sapphic romance from one of the main characters. The magic system is unique and the way you learn about it is interesting and holds your attention. The plot is fast paced and action packed. While I loved the twists and turns I did see all but one of them coming. I love being able to point to some tiny detail chapters back and say omg look! That’s the little hint of foreshadowing that we got. The hints in this story were very obvious to me, so I figured things out way before the characters did. Still had a great time and can’t wait for the next book!"

      "review": "I feel so lukewarm about this one! I guess we'll start with the good things.<br />I LOVE the diversity in this book. I LOVE that queer and disabled folk just ✨️exist✨️<br />It is so well done! The representation is not there just to be there, but nobody is coming out or feeling insecure about their differences. They are truly just living their lives and it was so refreshing!! Honestly, the best part about this entire book. 10 stars. <br />On to the things I didn't like so much...<br />I called the reveals extremely early on. Something happens towards the beginning that was so blatantly obvious to me and I spent basically the rest of the book not understanding how the characters didn't put it together faster. We also follow a very small cast of characters, so other reveals didn't hit very hard because there's only so many people it could be. I won't hold those things against this book though, I read a looooot of books, but I still feel it needed to be said.<br />I'd also like to talk about Yeeran for a minute. She has terrible taste in women. And while we're on the subject of romance....I hated it. It ruined the story for me. There's no chemistry. At all. None. Zero. The steam was SO jarring because of the lack of chemistry, but whateverrrr.<br />All that being said, I will read book 2 😆 and I'm also now intrigued to read The Final Strife. <br />Definitely pick this up if you're interested, but it's not perfect."

The lore and the creatures and the magic was just fantastic!!!! It almost seems real which just blows my mind!<br />- obviously the diversity! There’s queer characters, there’s characters that are physically different And persevere tremendously!!<br /><br />Meh…<br />- I felt things just happened too quick and too conveniently, the first part happens with a bang and then it prompts you for this epic journey. Well then things just conveniently start happening and the characters conveniently are “welcomed” with open arms<br />- I enjoyed the romance but I felt like that too was a bit rushed<br />- not sure what this age range is but if it’s adult 🥴 I could handle new adult but for adult this reads more childish with their actions and again how things just laid out to be<br /><br />I by all intents plan on continuing this series, I love the writing style and again this authors just grips by the reigns as far as a beautiful magical story. Just a few things that fell flat from reading her first trilogy to bouncing to this one."

I can see how their worlds sculpted them into who they are - rather than them existing in spite of the world around them. I can't wait to see what the rest of this trilogy brings them. I anticipate a lot of growth and a continued development of the interesting magic system that is developing so far.

      "review": "I received this ARC in exchange for my honest review.<br /><br />I've been waiting for Faebound ever since I read the plot description, and I was super excited - who wouldn't be excited for elves versus fae? POC and queer representation? A magic system that utilizes a musical instrument? Awesome. Unfortunately, as much as I wanted to love this book, it missed the mark for me. <br /><br />The characters are dry, and very plain with simple personalities. They were all just pawns being moved around from place to place for the sake of the plot with not much depth to any of them. If more of their backgrounds were given to us from an emotional standpoint I most likely would have felt connected to them in some way. The main romantic relationship seemed to come out of nowhere as the characters' minimal interactions beforehand didn't seem conducive to one. Fully grown adults acting so awkwardly around each other the way that sheltered teenagers would just didn't make sense with what we knew about them. The entire romance was just oddly unnatural and forced. <br /><br />I found it difficult to get immersed for a variety of reasons; the descriptions of everything were lacking. Characters were traveling and battling quite a lot but I felt there just weren't enough depictions of the environment, architecture, cultural clothing, physical characteristics, etc for me to get a grasp of what was going on. There was little to no emotive punctuation - when a character was angry at getting manhandled or even yelling, there were very few exclamation marks and italicized words for emphasis until the second half of the book. There were also a few emotional reactions that didn't fit the situation. <br /><br />I wish the worldbuilding was fleshed out more - the potential was there. To have different factions for fae and elves with their own distinct cultures was really cool and there were tons of possibilities to make from that but in general, the story just fell flat."

      "review": "First things first, I love the queer, disabled, and Afro/Afro tradition representation in this book! While I think we're definitely getting more fantasy books (as other genres) with more queer representation, there still isn't enough disabled and BIPOC representation (I specify this because we do often get Asian representation in the form of some side character from a nearby nation in the book's world that has some Asian-inspired culture and physical features in the form of olive/tan skin, almond/slanted eyes, and their peoples are usually skilled warriors/fighters, usually with swords, lol).<br /><br />I enjoyed the world-building in this and the introduction to the characters. That said, it did feel more like it was building up to *something* than actually having those elements within this story. I can see it setting up for a great series, though! It ended in a way that makes me curious enough to read the next installment. There's a big twist at the end that I enjoyed and it broke my heart a little. Also, I LOVE the Obeah and hope we get so much more of them, their wisdom, and goofy thoughts. I love a good found family trope, so I enjoyed the friendships that built in this first book but based on another big twist at the end surrounding the identity of one of the group members, I'm sure these bonds will be tested and we, the readers, will be shattered as the story develops further, lol. Can't wait! <br /><br />Thanks to the author, Random House Publishing, and NetGalley for allowing me to read an ARC of this book in exchange for my honest review."

      "review": "4.5/5 stars <br /><br />Faebound is an enchanting story about a Warrior exiled from her home and her diviner sister who follows her sister into an unknown world. When the sisters discover the fairytales they hear of Fae and humans are true when they find themselves captured by fae and everything they knew about the world changes. <br /><br />Can I just say I want an obeah? If you love the connection between dragons and riders or animals and fae, humans, elves then you will love the book. <br /><br />Faebound had great pacing keeping readers on their toes. I loved the lgbtq+ representation and the gender fluidity of characters in the book. I did wish the book spent more time developing the characters. Sometimes the lack of depth of different characters from early on in the book made it hard to empathize and connect with characters. In addition, the book was sometimes very predictable for me even though the characters didn’t catch on until much later. That being said I still thoroughly enjoyed it. <br /><br />I can’t wait until the next book to see where fate takes the characters. There is still so much adventure, political intrigue, romance and, I fear, heartbreak to be had in the world of Faebound. <br /><br />Thank you to the author, publisher, and NetGalley for the ARC for my honest review."

      "review": "War. War never changes. But the characters worldview might! Ah, what we do for love...or a good time. <br /><br />So, lets deep dive into this one! Some of the things I really loved about this story is the premise. The first page grabbed me with the whole \"storybook\" setting where it talks about the gods and each of the races. Right from the beginning the author tells us that there were originally three created races. Fae, elves, and humans. However, it's known by our main characters that they consider the elves to be the only remaining race alive. You follow two sisters, Yeeran and Lettle who are struggling through this Forever War created between different elf tribes. And they are STRUGGLING. I appreciate how the author is able to paint beautiful picture of what the war is doing to these characters and the choices that were made. <br /><br />After a few chapters this story turns away from war and leans more closely to its romantasy roots. This is where things were either a hit or a miss for me as a reader. I never found myself interested in Yeerans point of view and let me say, her choice in women has me waving a red flag all over those chapters. I never found myself attached to them, which I was a little sad about because I love a good saphic romance. However, I did appreciate the other sisters romantic interest and thought it was cute and well done. <br /><br />Trauma in this book feels...I don't know, overdone? If I took a shot for how many times Yeeran mentally dragged herself down from the choices she made- I would be down for the count. It got to the point I was rolling my eyes when Yeeran was back to blubbering about the same thing that she already said she was over chapters ago. I guess she wasn't. The characters really have some whiplash personality traits. One moment they are badass women ready to take down the next opponent and the next they just can't bare to leave their newly found romance because they just \"feel right.\" It feels out of character.<br /><br />Maybe I'm being overcritical for that point of view, because I myself, also have personality whiplash depending on my mood. <br /><br />Also, Obeah are introduced very early in this book. These are creatures that the elves hunt for magic power and have additional use to the plot later in the story. I have a hard time with really understanding Obeah and also connecting with them. <br /><br />I don't know. I preferred learning about the world and the plot of the war more than the romantasy. Also, are these characters just dumb because we literally got a whole prophecy that spells out exactly what was going to happen-I guessed it the moment we met the characters and no one could figure that out? I understand that guessing plot twists doesn't make it a bad story. But for me when everything goes exactly how I thought it would leaves me a little sad. <br /><br />The story was a good one. The whole world seriously captivated me, it was gorgeous. However, I am unable to relate to the characters and they honestly annoyed me most of the time other than Rayan. Bless him for just being the best. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good story with representation and in a mood for Romantasy."

The book started slow and took me a bit to get into it, but after about page 50, I was completely hooked! The world-building and magic system in this book was amazing, you could tell that the author poured her all into these aspects and did not just throw it together. The world-building was woven within the story making sure it did not feel forced upon the reader. This method made me feel like I was discovering the information with the characters. From the history of the Forever War to the starving child soldiers, to the hunting of the Obeah in order to wield magic, the author paints a vivid world around the reader. The Gods that governed this world were very unique and interesting, I enjoyed reading the small excerpts about them within the book to assist in the world-building. I loved the concept of the binding between the Fae and the Obeah- making them one with each other and gaining the knowledge of their likeliness to the other creatures in the story. From these discoveries, it pains you to recall the killing of the Obeah by the unknowing elves, as they were taking two innocent lives with their naivety. The characters were all very relatable and endearing. From the beginning, the author shows you multiple sides to each character making any betrayals or deceptions that much harder to stomach. The bond that Yeeran and Lettle shared helped to navigate me through their challenges and the struggles they faced. It was easy to imagine myself in these characters’ shoes and ask myself the question would I act any differently? The romance element of this story was very well done, I enjoyed the dual relationships that were flowering throughout the book and that neither of these detracted from or over consumed the main plot. The romance was worked into the book seamlessly and the intimate moments were not unfitting with the author’s beautiful writing as they too were enchanting. The representation and diversity in this book was outstanding, I thought the details of the characters were flawless as they were multifaceted and not identical to each other showing how realistic these characters were for a Fantasy. Lastly, the foreshadowing in this book was perfect! I caught myself thinking ahead of what I thought would occur and I did guess on a couple, but a few others had me thoroughly shocked! I loved trying to work out these little mysteries in my head and thinking back on scenes where I had my suspicions to help aid in my theories. Overall, I was thrilled to read this book, a first from this author for me, and definitely not the last! Thank you to NetGalley for the ARC, I am truly honored to be able to share in this author’s work! "

      "review": "I don't think I've ever been so happy to finish a book before. I had such high hopes for this (blame the pretty cover). I took a chance and pre-ordered the hardback back in November, which is something usually reserved for authors I've already established favouritism for, especially as I usually read on Kindle. But here we are - a barely dented spine and a 1 star review. <br /><br />The premise of Faebound is so *good* - a sapphic enemies to lovers fantasy with amazing representation and an original plot. That is, unfortunately, as far as my praise goes. The writing is choppy, jumping between scenes with no discernable warning, and with such little description of the current location that half the time I couldn't tell you where the characters actually were. It was very \"tell, don't show\". Speech was used in place of description, with characters constantly asking \"what does that mean\". I love a character with initiative, but this was so repetitive. I'm not sure if I'm missing something with the grammar in this writing style, but I really, really struggled with the excessive use of commas in place of full stops. I actually switched to the Spotify audiobook for an hour of this for my drive home, and it even sounded peculiar from the narrator. It really took away from the character depth that this story needed, and reminded me too much of something you'd write in school. <br /><br />I read something in somebody else's review that I really felt - that I was disappointed to essentially be told all the plot twists in a prophecy in the first hundred pages. I may have enjoyed the storyline more had I not known exactly what was going to happen as I first began to read. <br /><br />I won't even get into the romance as there are not enough synonyms for \"unbearable\" to do it justice. <br /><br />All in all, Faebound would work ten times better if the sex scenes were removed and this was marketed as YA. I loved the idea, but the finished product just wasn't for me. I haven't read anything else by this author but if you have, and you enjoyed it, you're already more likely to have fun with this than me."

This had this fairytale sensibility about it - innocent and simple but nevertheless, destroyed by power and greed. An age old tale. It felt similar to Avatar in the sense that they are deeply connected to spirit, culture and land. <br /><br />The two main characters of this book are two sisters with alternating POV chapters both dealing in vastly different internal and external battles. They are tested by one another and the world around them but ultimately find strength in one another which is really something! I love seeing this representation of platonic female love. <br /><br />Both sisters have a romance subplot which are very different but no less beautiful. Though I’d say one relationship felt a little more instalove despite the enemies to lovers narrative.<br /><br />This was very predictable. I could see the main twist coming from the very beginning but that didn’t make it any less enjoyable. Though I had difficulty suspending my disbelief at times - wondering how the characters DIDNT KNOW! <br /><br />The writing was great - had very few issues with it overall, with only a few cases of floating head syndrome.<br /><br />Overall, I loved the entire reading experience. It is diverse, beautiful, rich and thoughtful!<br /><br />If you want a TLDR; version:<br />- Romantic Fantasy <br />- Avatar world meets fae folklore<br />- multi POV in third<br />- sapphic and straight love<br />- twists<br />- betrayals<br />- power struggles and political moves<br />- war between different folk<br />- BIPOC representation and characters<br />- enemies to lovers"

      "review": "2.5⭐️ The world and magic were cool but everything else was a huge disappointment to be honest. Every single plot twist is painfully obvious, and it is extremely frustrating to enjoy the story when the reader already knows exactly what’s going to happen in an obviously unintended, not-dramatic-irony sort of way. Few of the main characters are particularly likeable (Lettle’s chapters were so hard to get through cause I hated her so much), and their backstories, along with most of the world building, are clumsily divulged in awkward conversations that read more like infodumps than actual dialogue. The instalove of one of the main characters hits like 15% of the way through and the way their relationship “develops” over the subsequent 85% couldn’t be less compelling if it tried. Like the rest of the plot the romance pairings are glaringly obvious, but I do give the author bonus points for a queer-normative society and a sapphic main relationship. That aspect was refreshing to read and I did like both of those characters. <br /><br />But there is not a single red herring to be found, making the villains and twists obvious (I know I keep saying this but it was SO predictable it’s unbelievable). Important plot points are introduced with massive unexplained plot holes (i.e. characters witnessing magic that shouldn’t exist then not caring to question it until it becomes a plot point?) then ignored until a half-assed twist brings them back up as some gotcha moment the reader could see coming a mile away. I did appreciate where this book ended and will be vaguely curious to see where the plot goes next in terms of the world building and magic system, but I won’t be subjecting myself to actually reading the next book.

Her sister, Lettle, is trying to make a living as a diviner, seeking prophecies of a better future. When a fatal mistake leads to Yeeran’s exile from the Elven lands, they are both forced into the terrifying wilderness beyond their borders. There they encounter the impossible: the fae court. The fae haven’t been seen for a millennium. But now Yeeran and Lettle are thrust into their seductive world – torn between their loyalty to each other, their elven homeland, and their hearts. <br /><br />💜 I'm honestly struggling to write this review. Faebound is immediately spellbinding, the world-building vivid yet not too intricate. The writing is immersive, woven from threads of African and Arab cultures. This is the perfect read for Pride Month, especially for romantasy readers. The normalcy surrounding queerness and gender neutrality from the start is absolute gold (\"[Their] gender was as flexible as the weather, accepted like the fall of rain, and change welcomed like the turns of seasons.\"); a breathtaking delight that fits perfectly into any fantasy realm. The story's sapphic relationship is layered and interesting; I only wish it was given more time to develop and blossom. <br /><br />💜 Perhaps I'm biased (I have three younger sisters), but I absolutely love stories involving sisters. Yeeran and Lettle give the story balance, their distinct personalities and viewpoints of the world giving us insight without too much sway in one direction. The little \"journal\" at the end with everyone's handwritten notes was the perfect addition to the story; a cute glossary that's often necessary for hefty world-building.<br /><br />💙 As much as I loved the writing, the characters, the themes, and even the setting...the plot felt lacking to me. There's a moment where the story slows as the characters grow complacent in their new surroundings, which would have been a great opportunity to delve into the mythology or culture. Puzzle pieces are set up a bit too obviously, too; the twists are easy to anticipate. Regardless, I'm curious to see how the story continues.<br /><br />🦇 Recommended for fans of The Priory of the Orange Tree, Girls of Paper and Fire, Spice Road, and Legends &amp; Lattes.<br /><br />✨ The Vibes ✨<br />🥁 Queer FMC/Sapphic Ships (Queernormativity)<br />🍃 Fantasy Fiction/Romantasy (Fae &amp; Elves)<br />🥁 Dual POV (Sisters)<br />🍃 Rivals to Lovers <br />🥁 Afro/Arab World<br />🍃 First of a Trilogy<br />🥁 BIPOC Author<br /><br />💬 Quotes <br />❝ And where there is value, there is power, and where there is power, violence will always brew. ❞<br />❝ ‘You are the fire of my heart, and the beat of my drum.

      "review": "Honestly, I expected more from this book. It's described as this adult fantasy about elves and fae and there's Sapphic romance and there's a war! And like wow I wanted to read that! Turns out, yes! All those things are in this book! They're just... Not that greatly executed. <br /><br />First of all, I did enjoy reading this, most of the time. It was entertaining, it was strangely cozy and low stakes. That's just not what I expected or wanted from this book. <br /><br />So in the premise, it talks about this great war that's been going on. Yeah, we see it for about 5 chapters and that's it. <br /><br />Then there's the characters. Our 3bmain characters are okay, but sometimes felt flat. They would, in my opinion, act 'out of character' to forward the plot. If they didn't, then some other background character did. Honestly, no one else needed a name, 'plot device' would have been enough. <br /><br />The the world building. It was interesting, but so vague? I don't know what a' obeah looks like apart from big horns and black or brown fur. The elven and fae lands? I have no idea about any of those things because basically nothing is said about it! <br /><br />What I disliked the most was the romance. Or 'romance' because it did not feel real or authentic to me. Both romances are insta love, then they have sex, then they are 'together' and so very much in love??? There was basically no development, they just went with it. What do you mean the first thing you think about your kidnapper is 'you' re so hot' and that's basically enough to make you fall in love? <br /><br />The romance is the reason I am not willing to rate this higher. Honestly, had that been better it could have been a 3,even a 4 star read. I'm really disappointed. <br /><br />I will say! I liked the effortlessly, 'queer as the norm' world. If you're looking for a cozy, no brain-usage needed fantasy this might be for you!"

Yeeran is a colonel that makes a deadly miscalculation in battle and is exiled; Lettle, her younger sister, is a diviner, and vows to track her down. <br /><br />The world-building is very interesting. The goals of the characters make sense. There are many tropes that will appeal to fantasy romance readers. Enemies-to-lovers, Only one bed, star-crossed lovers, etc. There are some familiar beats in the story that Sarah J Maas fans will appreciate similar to A Court of Thorns and Roses. It had some of the density of Priory of the Orange Tree and sapphic fiction.<br /><br />Fresh take on old fantasy classics by putting a different cultural spin on them. Gender, racial, and sexual diversity fill up the book along with some disabilities. The author does a good job about discussing them, but not making the disability define the character. It shapes their experience, but also is just a part of this world.<br /><br />The beginning took me awhile to get into. The characters start in dangerous situations and keep getting into trouble. Lettle grated on me as it seems like she is frequently yelling or complaining and it’s hard to root for<br />Someone's like that. There are many characters and hard to get a good sense of what they want and are motivated by. Overall."

      "review": "I'm writing this only a few days after finishing the book, and the first words that come to mind are forgettable and underwhelming. <br /><br />Initially, I was so hyped to read this. I watched a TikTok where the guy was raving about the lore and the world-building and the characters and the originality. So exciting, fresh fantasy. Well, I feel like I read a different book because, unfortunately, this was pretty plain fantasy to me. <br /><br />On paper, the premise is great. The lore sets up this idea that there were three gods that created humans, elves, and fae. The elves are all that's left, and they're locked in an endless war, battling with drum-based magic, until a few of them stumble upon a hidden fae city. The author promises Afro-Arab influence and queer normativity. <br /><br />So, that's great. I'm thinking about how these three potentially wildly different cultures could clash with each other, they could have different lifestyles, different cities, different clothing, the magic bestowed upon them by their personal god is different. And we could explore this through a fresh lens compared to that traditional, Lord of the Rings fantasy. <br /><br />The main problem I have is that it all just feels a little underbaked. We don't really dig into these cultures and, honestly, everything feels interchangeable, anyway. The elves and the fae may as well be humans, except that the elves have pointy ears and the fae have sharp teeth. EVERYTHING may as well be human! The lifestyles, the cities, the clothing.<br /><br />Even the magic system, the set-up kind of tells us that there are three types of magic, one for each god and species. But then everyone can use any magic if they just concentrate the right way? So what's the point? <br /><br />I also think that the writing is a little too simplistic and quick. The backdrop for the plot is just a generic war story and a hidden, cursed land. And I feel like we fly through plot points so quickly. Like, the fae haven't been seen in so long that people literally believe that they're mythical creatures. Our elves discover them and they're just like, \"Dude. Crazy.\" And then they just assimilate. And I'm sorry, but I just did not believe the enemies-to-lovers arc. It boils down to, \"Wow, she's SUPER hot.\" and \"That was nice of her to pick mangoes for the people; maybe I COULD overlook her murdering my brother.\" Overall, I found the characters to be pretty one-dimensional. <br /><br />The obeah are probably the most well-written part of the story, and I enjoyed the way that they played a different role in the elf and fae cultures. Unfortunately, that difference goes away quickly, but I think it's a good example of how you could potentially explore cultural differences. Still, it's hard to go wrong with bonded familiars, and I definitely liked them. <br /><br />I think the ending of the book relies too heavily on several \"twists\" to try to inject a little excitement, but I don't think it works for two reasons. One, the twists are relatively predictable because of prophecies, and the trouble with these prophecies is that they HAVE to come true but they're not vague enough to hide the answers or allow for loopholes. Two, I just don't really feel it because the characters and the emotionality aren't believable enough for me. <br /><br />Finally, I appreciate that the author wanted to incorporate Afro-Arab culture and queer normativity. I also think that the story wanted to explore some themes of racism and gender and otherness, and that's great, one thing that I really love about fantasy is that it can use genre tropes to give you a different perspective of these topics which can also apply to real life. But in this book, I think the exploration was pretty shallow. There's a few pretty ham-fisted lines like, \"Oh, gender is fluid here, too!\" and \"Oh, maybe we SHOULDN'T hate an entire group of people based on where they were born.\" And a few people have different pronouns. I just think it could've done so much more. <br /><br />And I guess that really sums it up, actually. I just think it could've been so much more, and that's what's disappointing. Because even though all I've done is complain about what I see as shortcomings from my perspective, it's not a bad book. It's fine. "

The author did a great job at building the world we were in and leaving little bread crumbs for us to follow as we read that made some of the big reveals that much more shocking and satisfying. There is so much fantastic representation in this... a variety of queer relationships and identities, disability, and afro/arab influences (as taken from the author description). I loved our main characters and the found family bond that forms between them and even when the author had me doubting some of the characters she would find a way to bring me right back around to them again. Also, for all the spicy lovers out there... there were a few saucy scenes that would definitely scratch that itch for you. I could see some people complaining that some of the relationships seem a bit insta-love but not only is time passing over the course of the story but the situations that the characters are in lends itself to a fast developing relationship. Listen, I was here for all the flirting and banter and tension. Give me more.<br /><br />Honestly though my absolute favorite part of the book was Pila. She is the most precious and adorable character with her witty little comebacks and nonchalant attitude about almost everything. She added the best element to this and I can't wait to get more of her. <br /><br />I am so looking forward to continuing on in this series and picking up the author's previous work.<br /><br />Content Warning: war, animal death, starvation, assault, loss of a parent/child "

I wish the world building was more intricate and we saw more of the politics and character development. That being said, there was amazing representation in this fantasy, and if you love queer fantasy and are willing to not think too hard and just vibe, which I often am, you are guaranteed to have a good time. Just don’t listen to the audiobook because the main character Yeeran is pronounced like “urine” which really is not the vibe during a spicy scene. I agree with a lot of the negative points other people have made in reviews, but I also agree with a lot of the positive ones and I think it’s all about what you are trying to get out of this book. Does it have the best writing or most intricate plot? No. But it does have cute romance and prophecies to solve and a cool mythical creature with bonding and mind speak. I’m giving it a 3.75"

After reading reviews I thought I'd hate it. For me it's a solid 2.7. <br /><br />Positives:<br />I really like the world building. I like the three races, the gods, and the hidden civilization trope. I do kind of wonder about the culture being \"millennia\" old and still using drums and spears etc. <br /><br />The core of the plot seems cool, but we don't get enough of it. There is so much drama with the race stuff that I think it needs more actual plot to balance it out. I felt the need to skim read a lot bc it was pretty boring at large sections. That being said, a hidden civilization, an exterminated race, a war over resources, plus political intrigue within each nation - super cool.<br /><br />The coincidence of not one, but two elves becoming faebound.... Really bleh. Like just way too easy. <br /><br />Negative:<br />The progressive messaging felt like I was being beaten over the head with a gender studies class. There's a way to write LGBTQ characters and settings without being a preachy brat and this author has no concept of that. It felt like this was her only real motivation for writing the book most of the time and honestly it detracted from any other good thing in here. <br /><br />The romance was so trite and boring and made no sense. It was basically not romance just immediate sexual attraction with slightly delayed gratification. No romance to be had at all.<br /><br />The whole drum missile thing.... I cracked up. Like what even! Not believable at all. It felt gimmicky and like she was grasping at straws. <br /><br />Now let's get into the obeah. <br />Such a cool-ish sounding creature! We don't get enough of a description. Plus, compared to other bonded animal novels, the obeah in here are treated like side characters instead of main characters. And when they are present, they are boring and one note. I expect eragorn, forth wing, dire wolf level interaction and importance from sentient animals! <br /><br />Lastly, the chosen one trope of an elf getting an obeah? Super cool. Was it executed well? No. It happens and then is immediately discarded from the plot. Such a waste."

      "review": "Romantasy is the name of the game these days, and while the big names like Garber, Maas and Yarros are taking fantasy readers by storm, I've not really been interested on hopping on the trend. Faebound however, found the perfect way to lure me in; afro-arab fantasy aesthetics. <br /><br /><br />I think it's a sign that romantasy might just not be for me, because the romance in this book was way less compelling than the fantasy. When I think of high points for Faebound, I think of the interesting history between the Humans, Elves and Fae. I think about the Obeah, and their contradictory value to the elves and Fae. I think about how the book presents societies with more liberal ideas around gender expression and sexuality. <br /><br /><br />Of the 2 major romances in the plot, one I found quite compelling despite its rocky start. This couple felt like they escalated a little quicker than I'd like, but I felt relieved when they got together. Part of this is because it meant an end to a bunch of drama caused by terrible communication on all sides. The other, I found completely romantically unconvincing. I could buy that those characters desired each other, but nothing that happens between them felt like love. I find that romance stories often mistake attachment and lust for love, and unfortunately that mistake continues here. <br /><br /><br />The plot itself I enjoyed. A little too prophecy-dependent in my opinion, but characters have clear motivations and justifications for their decisions, even if they're often making the wrong decisions. There are a chunky amount of twists in the plot, some which I predicted quite easily, and some that caught me completely off guard. To me, that says that the author ensured there were enough things for the audience to figure out, and be surprised by. This and the well written prose helped keep me reading even when I came across my least favourite sections.<br /><br /><br />I do have a preference for hard magic systems, so the looser magic found here didn't absolutely grab me. I did however love the idea of using magic drums as a replacement for modern firearms. For plot reasons the drums exit the story for a while, but they get reintroduced in a narratively poignant way. I also wish the promised afro-arab elements were more present, but they showed up frequently enough to satisfy my expectations.<br /><br /><br />Overall, I found Faebound to be an enjoyable read, and a good entry point into the romantasy sub-genre. However, I think my personal tastes stopped me from enjoying it more. I plan to read the eventual sequel, but I wouldn't say I'm particularly excited for it."

      "review": "2.5 <br /><br /><br />WARNING: I can be a mean bitc* sometimes (like right now while writing this) so do not read if this is your darling! Or read and hate me- whatever. Do you!<br /><br />Faebound? You meant Messbound right?<br /><br />Let me start by saying that I think the idea behind the whole plot was good! The twists had potential. <br />I'd like to think this whole thing had potential. But here is the little sad story of Potential.<br />Potential was born on a sunny, lovely day. It learned to walk and talk and love and one day, Potential decided it was time for it to explore the world. Potential got dressed in its best clothes and headed for the main door, an adventure was waiting for it! <br />But alas....As soon as Potential got out on the pavement in front of its house it got run over by a truck. Squashed before it could take his first lungful of air. Bye Bye Potential. You'll be missed.<br />End of story.<br /><br />This just lacked characterization. Like a massive lack of it. The world-building was not much better. The writing also was not my style. Overall a messy execution. <br /><br />*spoilers ahead!*<br /><br />A lot of things made poor sense. Like when Yeeran gets stabbed in the torso and is put on bedrest but the next day, bored, she gets out for a run and runs for miles. MILES. Now, let's not take me as an example ok? If I cut too much a nail on one finger I refuse to use my hands for a couple of days and have to be spoon-fed, but on the other hand, getting stabbed in the chest and going for a bloody run the next day? Like is there ANYTHING else the author could have made this character do to occupy the time that does not involve possible organ damage?<br /><br />A lot of other things were just so cringe. Like the almost sexual touching of each other Obeahs? (Obeahs are animals, not body parts- just to clarify). That was the time I put the book down and I had to give myself a pep-talk to pick it back up again (which also taught me I should NEVER listen to myself).<br /><br />And the love interests? What was THAT?<br /><br /><br />Yeeran and Furi- the enemy to lovers promised bit- had initially some Potential (Potential Junior if you want but Potential Jr. died too, on the same doorstep as its older brother, struck by lightning on a perfect sunny day). <br />That is NOT how you do enemies to lovers. It is just not. One minute they hate each other, the other minute they are getting down to business and in love and then hate again in the morning and promising again eternal love by tea time...This could even be entertaining if the writing was not so...boring. I'm sorry, the writing was boring. I pushed through this book to see Furi and Yeeran happen (because it was obvious it would be) and when it happened she managed to make it boring. It's like being all excited to go on holiday but when you arrive you get the flu and spend the whole week in a hotel bed. Anticlimactic.<br /><br />Now, if Furi and Yeeran were ultimately a disappointment, Lettle and Ryan were just a joke.<br />First of all, when did it happen? Did I receive a book lacking a couple hundred pages that can explain those two together to me? Because last time I had checked they were just walking through a forest after having spoken two sentences to each other EVER, then they got captured, and boom! Ryan is all lovey-dovey for Lettle and vice versa. Maybe they hit their heads too hard when they captured them? So a second before \"hi, my name is\" &amp; the second after \"love of my life\". Then Lettle decides that they are not meant to be but her resolution wavers soon after when they are standing on top of a couple of murdered bodies (because nothing shouts love of my life like a bit of murder I guess). Honestly, the romance was so bad I didn't even find the timing so awkward after all. For a second I thought those two dead queens had died after having eavesdropped Ryan saying to Lettle: \"Let me bleed to death. For I've reached Nirvana\". I wish she had taken him up on his words and let him bleed (Also Nirvana? I mean I guess humans became extinct but left Buddhism behind just so Ryan could make me throw up in my mouth).<br /><br />A bummer. I won't continue with this series. Despite what it might look like, I don't look forward to leaving negative reviews so I better quit the series before I become Super-Saiyan-Mean here.<br /><br />*I have a Youtube channel where I review books, have a look if you fancy: <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKINi_gWxRVjojxMeKtKi1Q\">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKIN...</a>"

      "review": "🎧 - ⭐️/5<br /><br />I feel that with Romantasy as a whole, I get a watered-down version of both Fantasy and Romance.<br /><br />I never get the deep relationship and character stories from a romance, but it is also missing solid worldbuilding, magic, and plot from a fantasy. Everything feels so on the nose and trope-heavy that it lacks all sorts of originality. Of course, that goes from my limited experience with the genre, and maybe there are stronger reads out there that I haven't found yet. Sadly, Faebound did not work for me because of these reasons and several more.😩<br /><br />The overall blurb sounds interesting. We are following two elven sisters set in a world filled with war. After the older sister(Yeeran) makes a grand mistake, she is banished from the elven land in exile. The younger sister goes after her, and they find themselves captured by the supposedly extinct fae. Rayan, a handsome soldier with \"a jaw that he could wield as a weapon,\" also decides to tag along.<br /><br />A good premise, but the way everything is laid out makes this story so predictable. Again, with the heavy tropes and eye-rolling moments with the \"tension\" between the bantering. The characters feel flat, one-note, and naive. They also read very young in the way they behave, but they are supposedly in their late 20s/mid-30s. The younger sister was especially challenging with the tantrums we see from toddlers. I swear, Lettle in this story made this 10 times harder to get through than it should have been. <br /><br />The coupling in this book was also... not good. Rayan has the personality of cardboard, doing nothing except saying the word \"Lettle\" every time he is on the page. Trust me... it gets annoying real quick. Why he likes Lettle I do not understand. I think the author tried to do like a headstrong, confident female lead, but she did not come across this way. Flailing your arms and screaming on top of your lungs...; surprisingly does not work with the Fae guards. Who would have thought? <br /><br />Furi was also... a choice. Writing enemies to lovers is not the easiest, and I feel like we have seen the trope so much lately that if it is not done perfectly, it simply does not work. I truly did not understand why Yeeran and Furi had the hots for each other. There was no chemistry whatsoever. <br /><br />And then there is the overall story, which, surprisingly, is... very boring. Having a \"prophecy\" told every other chapter makes this whole book feel very repetitive, but I also feel like it lacked flair and tension. I know that in Romantasy there is supposed to be more focus on the romance aspect of it, but when the whole story feels \"meh,\" and there isn't a lot for the characters to do here...<br /><br />Yeeran was out training. Rayan was out training. Lettle was out... complaining.<br />Not a fun ride for 200 pages of the book. Also... the \"plot twist.\" Yeah... no one was surprised.<br /><br />I wanted to like this! I truly did. The cover is stunning. A good premise. Sapphic romance with BIPOC characters. We need more of this in fantasy! But this, sadly, was not it😞<br /><br />(should I have DNFed this? Yes. Did I do it....no)<br /><br />"

      "review": "I voluntarily read and reviewed an advanced copy of this book. All thoughts and opinions are my own.<br /><br />I am simply in awe of this book!! Sapphic epic fantasy at its finest!<br /><br />Yeeran is the sister who was a colonel in the Elven Army of the Waning tribe. In the battlefield, she made a decision that resulted in many deaths, and her punishment was exile. For Yeeran, that was worse than death, but even in exile, she thrived. She didn't despair *much* and immediately started planning how to bargain her return. A competent, resourceful woman after my own heart! I absolutely loved Yeeran!!!!!!! I loved how strong she was, mentally and physically. She's had so many obstacles, so many struggles, and yet, she just forged ahead. Even when her optimism and strength wavered, she still managed to be confident in her not-so-confident state, if that makes any sense. <br /><br />The other main character is Lettle, who has been studying and working with divination for years. If Yeeran is the sister who succeeds, then Lettle is the sister who struggles, but I feel that's how Lettle sees themselves, and it's not necessarily true. Yeeran does shine the brightest, but Lettle is also a wonderful character with a lovely character development arc. She's not weak or annoying, but she's definitely the youngest stubborn sibling 😂 I really liked her POV chapters, too. She was refreshing!<br /><br />The world-building and dual romance were impressive!! Yes, you read that right, DUAL ROMANCE!! Our warrior sister, Yeeran, definitely has a type: a strong, beautiful woman with serious leadership skills, which made me love her even more. I really enjoyed that she wasn't the prudent, innocent, not-had-a-relationship-before woman because we've all seen that a lot of times. It's not a love triangle because I feel that her previous relationship has ended, and Yeeran makes that clear, too. Lettle's romance blossoms throughout the book, and her love interest is sooooo appealing that he'll make us bisexuals crazy with indecision 😂<br /><br />The worldbuilding where we have fae and elves (and long-lost humans) stood out as one of the book's strongest points. The history and depth of background we were offered made me admire the author a lot. This is the epitome of lush worldbuilding, and yet, we were never overwhelmed. We got what we needed when we needed it, with glorious details and masterful prose. I especially loved the obeahs! How they're connected to a fae, and how they feel like a part of their soul they cannot live without. It's such a beautiful element, and it made my heart yearn for an obeah of my own. <br /><br />Pila, I love you with all my heart, and I will protect you no matter what. You're the most beautiful creature of all creatures. <br /><br />The plot was strong, and while I saw one of the twists coming, I do appreciate how Lettle didn't connect the dots. Having your life and your sister's life threatened every day would make anyone lose their strategic marbles.... However, I didn't see the bigger plot twist, and I was euphoric about it. I loved the twist, and I loved that I didn't see it coming. <br /><br />While I didn't enjoy the author's debut, this book is a masterpiece. One of the very best epic fantasy books out there, and the fact that it's a sapphic epic fantasy just makes it transcend even more. If you're a fan of Tasha Suri, Shelley Parker-Chan or C.L. Clark aka the sapphic trifecta, you're going to love this book. Faebound wrecked me for all other epic fantasy books, and I couldn't be more thrilled about it. <br /><br />If you only read one adult epic fantasy, let this be it. A GLORIOUS MASTERPIECE OF A NOVEL!!!"

      "review": "Actual Rating: 3.5 Stars. After reading The Ending Fire I expected a lot from Faebound, but ultimately it fell short in plot, character development, and romance.<br /><br />Faebound is far more of a romantasy than an epic fantasy, which is the main reason it's not nearly as successful as The Ending Fire. Instead of focusing on the plot, the story revolves around several lackluster romantic relationships and overemploys the forbidden love trope. No romantic relationship comes easy in this book; whether it's a prophecy foretelling doom or a conflict between the fae and elves, there's always something keeping these lovers apart.<br /><br />Despite these obstacles, there are multiple open door, intimate scenes, both straight and sapphic. There is also an odd inclusion of a one-bed situation along with other tropey scenes that seemed tonally inconsistent with the rest of the book. It was like this book couldn't decide if it wanted to be a light, comedic romantasy or a serious, epic fantasy. The whole elf/fae conflict is often pushed to the background in favor of creating situations to develop the relationships between the two main couples.<br /><br />I must always give props for the queer normative society and diverse characters. I am here for the sapphic romance and inclusion of nonbinary characters, as well as a main character who is disabled.<br /><br />The magic system was interesting; the use of drums to control magic, divination, and mage sight! However, the world building was missing a lot... Honestly, I didn't even realize that the fae world was underground until much later in the book! And we spend so little time in the elf world, though perhaps that will be remedied in future books. <br /><br />Overall, this story and world lacked the nuance and twists that made The Ending Fire so successful, and the direction of the story felt predictable and overly contrived. At some points I was so frustrated with the characters for misinterpreting things that I, as the reader, saw so easily. While still an interesting story, it wasn't exactly a page turner.<br /><br />I alternated reading and listening and unfortunately cannot recommend the audiobook at all. The narrator was not a good fit for an adult epic fantasy and imposed a certain immaturity to the characters. Her pronunciation of the character names was frustrating (Yeeran= Urine?!) and there were odd pauses and spacing between words."

      "review": "Thank you to Del Rey and NetGalley for an ARC in exchange for an honest review.<br />DNF at ~75%<br /><br />Pros: gender diversity that doesn't feel forced, sapphic romance, cool animal bonds/familiars.<br />When I read this description, I was intrigued by the idea of elves being thrust into a fae world, with the promise of a more diverse and non-Western approach to world building. I like how the myths of the world are interpersed in the story, telling the tale of three gods and the being they created - elves, fae, and humans. I also liked the unique way of using magic that is introduced early on (using 'drumfire') and the introduction of sentient beings like the obeah (horned feline-like creatures). The society is genderqueer, with specific references to being non-binary and gender fluidity in ways that don't feel overly forced, but instead are just describing the people.<br /><br />Cons: lack of world-building, anachronisms, stilted and clumsy dialogue, awkward writing<br /><br />Lack of worlding building: After the intial few chapters, the world building fell really flat. The idea of these three types of beings, who were constantly at war with each other until one prevailed had so much potential for commentary on war-mongering and the consequences of such violence. Instead, we are presented with characters who are so entrenched in war that even as circumstances change, so much of the goal is to \"get back home so I can solve this war\". In the story, we quickly learn that the fae are not actually extinct as assumed, but have been locked away by magic and we are introduced to this literally underground commune-type place. Except despite the fae not supposed to be able to leave, some can leave and they also have a fully functioning military (who are they fighting?) The politics behind the way the races and tribes interact is so simplified that is becomes illogical, with no nuance that makes political schemes intriguing.<br /><br />Anachronisms: related to world building, I found some of the dialogue and writing to be jarring. For example, this is supposed to be a magical world, somewhat similar to ours (not a lot of real detail in terms of maps or descriptors), with magical creatures like the obeah. However, at one point, an obeah references a platypus in conversation. It's meant to bring like a humorous moment, but instead I'm stuck thinking - this magical world has platypus? How would either of these characters know what that is? Is this supposed to be a version of our world?<br /><br />Clumsy dialogue and relationships: this story tries so hard to force these romantic tropes (particularly enemies to lovers) and I don't think it is successful. There is absolutely no burn or relationship building, slow or otherwise, with characters instead just sort of insta-love and lusting for each other (like, we get it, everyone is beautiful, but is that all there is?). The characters are supposed to be adults who have lived through war and trauma, but they read as much younger and less experienced.<br /><br />Clunky writing: frequency typo and seeming missing punctuation aside, I found the writing really stilted and awkward. For example, instead of integrating desriptors into the action, it is also separated with a lot of \"Her dress was blah blah. Her skin was golden. \" type writing (not actual quotes).<br /><br />I feel like the story had a lot of potential, but overall was a let down for me."

      "review": "This is my pleas for the ACOTAR girlies to pick up this book about sapphic, black fae!! There are not enough sapphic or BIPOC fantasy romance stories out there, so consider this a lil nudge to diversify your reading…with a book that’s already up your alley. <br /><br />In a world that is constantly at war, Yeeran, our main character, has just been promoted to Colonel of her elven tribe and, after a grave mistake on her very first day, she’s been exiled by the ruler and her lover as a disgrace. Her little sister and diviner, Lettle, goes off into the desert after her, with Yeeran’s second in command, Rayan, in tow, determined to bring her home - not knowing that Yeeran’s schemed up a way to get herself out of exile. Yeeran’s hare-brained plan ends up backfiring and they are forced to contend with myths and legacies long believed to be false or dormant. <br /><br />With curses and prophesies and drum magic abound, I especially loved that Yeeran was forced to confront her own willful blindness and the role she plays in perpetuating military propaganda. The writing construction was a little clunky at times and plot sometimes predictable, but the character building, multi-POVs and the messaging around the consequences of war and colonization – and how that leads to compounded generational trauma – had me glued to every page. On top of it all, I adored how queer-normative and disability normative the story was, which is refreshing for a fantasy book. FAEBOUND was a story about sisterhood and prophesy and has a little sprinkle of an enemies-to-lovers plotline as well. I can’t wait to see how the story continues in book 2!<br /><br />Special thanks to Netgalley and Random House Publishing Group – Ballantine for sharing this digital reviewer’s copy with me in exchange for my honest reviews."

I think she was awful, and downright fucking mean. I understand it’s enemies to lovers, but even after they were lovers, she was a dickhead. The world building was good, and so was the twist at the end."

Yeeran banished from her tribe, travels to the east, along with her sister Lettle, to find a way to end her exile. However, they instead discover something or someone’s thought to no longer exist.This is a the story of two sisters and their journey to navigate the fates and a world thought to be that of folklore.<br /><br />To say I enjoyed this book would be an understatement because I loved this book so much! I could not stop gasping every time I finished a chapter. There were twists and turns throughout this book and I throughly enjoyed the ride! The prologue was pure perfection and I fell into the story immediately, learning about the different gods and their parts in the creation of the humans, the fae, and the elves. Our cast of characters were so dynamic and diverse! I loved the queer normative representation. The enemies to lovers was everything I love about the trope without being redundant or exhausting. <br /><br />The writing made it easy to digest the story without losing the power to enchant and capture its reader. The world building was intricate and done so beautifully, you could really picture every scene written by our author. I also really enjoyed the magic system, it wasn’t overcomplicated and completely different from anything that I’ve read before! All in all this was a 4.5/5⭐️ and I highly recommend!<br /><br />Thank you NetGalley and Delrey Books for the early arc!!"

      "review": "This book was genuinely like nothing I’ve ever read before. I loved how real and raw the characters were. They all had secrets and flaws, but also outstanding qualities that were so well written. They were fiercely loyal, wary, mistrustful, clever, and so loveable. One thing that I absolutely adored about the characters is that they all had such realistic and believable reactions. They cried when they were angry or upset. They laughed with humor and hysteria. They fought for what they believed in, took ownership for their mistakes, grew as people, and worked to expand their understanding of the world. Each character had strengths and weaknesses not just of character, but also of ability. Some were physically capable, some mentally, some could do things that others would not be able to do no matter how hard they tried, and some learned skills that they would never be as good at as others were naturally. I genuinely felt connected to the characters in this book.<br /><br />The relationship between the sisters and the relationship between Pila and Yeeran were some of my favorite parts of the book. Yeeran and Lettle’s interactions genuinely felt like conversations between sisters. They bickered and annoyed each other, but they also loved each other deeply and defended one another fiercely. I loved how they could be mid-conversation about something, stop to throw in a congratulatory remark, continue the conversation, pause to needle at the other, and then carry on. This is one of the best depictions of siblings I’ve read in a book, and I thought it was especially impressive considering the book is so far from being set in a world anything like the one I live in.<br /><br />The representation in this book felt natural and well written. I thought that the fae language and not being faebound in general were such excellent ways of representing disabilities. I also thought that the characters who were shown to have physical disabilities were done extremely well, especially with the way that we can see how one of the main character’s physical disability affects her day-to-day life. There was also a lot of LGBT+ representation in the book. I really appreciated how things such as characters’ gender identities and expressions were noted during the book without it ever seeming like anything but the typical part of life that it was for the characters. I also thought that the queer relationships were beautifully written.<br /><br />The way that the bias that the different species held for each other was explained, discussed, and slowly unlearned by the main characters was incredibly well done. The explanation of the expression “sun sins”, for example, with Yeeran admitting that she had never considered the implication of the words after having it pointed out. I appreciated the way that the characters began to consider their own biases during the course of the story and realize that the prejudices that they had grown up hearing were untrue.<br /><br />The cultures that were created in this book were intricate and had so much depth to them. I was continuously wowed by the world-building in Faebound, particularly so far as things such as dress, ceremonies, and mythology were concerned. The ways that the myths the characters knew were revealed to be a mixture of fact and fiction was so interesting and constantly kept me guessing. The book gives the best descriptions of the settings and appearances of characters of anything I’ve read in a while. I loved that the clothing being worn, the flora and fauna around, and even small details such as placement and appearance of furniture were consistently described. <br /><br />The magic in this book was an absolute highlight for me. Learning about how and why it worked, as well as the different types of magic that existed, was not only one of the most engaging parts of the book, but it was a part of the book that I thought tied everything else in it together beautifully. I liked how the skills that the elves already possessed were adapted or utilized in the fae lands. I absolutely loved divination and stopped to analyze every prophesy created repeatedly throughout the duration of the book. Becoming heedless was a unique idea that I thought expanded the world greatly.<br /><br />Lastly, the plot of this book was gripping, shocking, and well planned. There were plot twists that I guessed because they were well foreshadowed that were then followed up with even bigger twists that I didn’t see coming in the slightest. I gasped aloud several times while reading this book because it was so beautifully done. I cannot express how much I enjoyed this book. Every element of the story was written perfectly. It is so obvious that a huge amount of planning, talent, and care went into this book, and I cannot wait for the next one!"

      "review": "I don't even know what to say about this book besides that it feels messy. The pacing is off. The characters are flat, not especially likeable, and have some of the clunkiest dialogue I've ever read. The romance is... something. The worldbuilding is shallow. The storyline alternates between too convenient to be believable and so outlandish that it's unbelievable. I want this review to be spoiler free, but as an example, it would be like reading something with the chosen one trope, but then there's like five chosen ones and they all happen to be in the same place at the same time. mmmmkay. <br /><br />Then there's the little things that are just pet peeves in books, like a character realizing a skill exists and then somehow masters it overnight or a character somehow managing to learn a notoriously hard to learn language in just a few days and well enough to translate entire books with just a dictionary. Like what??? So many things just didn't add up here. I know we are supposed to suspend belief in fantasy, but that's for things like elves existing, not things that yank you out of the story because it's so eyeroll worthy. And don't forget everyone's favorite pet peeve - author infodumps lore and worldbuilding via a character taking lessons/interviewing another character/etc. Sigh. <br /><br />This book presented some really cool concepts that I wish it delivered on more. The setup was exciting for the first 10% or so. I loved that this is a casually queer world without exception. I also really liked the drum magic - that felt really fresh and new to me. I'm a sucker for any type of situation involving familiars and the like, so that was another aspect I actually enjoyed. But those few examples are about it. <br /><br />My whole timeline is either 5 stars or 2 stars, so at least other people are having a better time than I did. Personally, I wish I'd DNF'd this one. Whomp. "

      "review": "This book engages you in a vivid story and a captivating romance all at once. Stack that on top of a unique world and magic system, and you find yourself lulled into reading while hours pass unnoticed. <br /><br />The romance element in this was important but secondary to the plot. If we took out all the romance and everyone just became friends instead of lovers, the story could have moved forward. Though the romance made the plot all that much more compelling. I always find it when the book does both so well. It’s a hard balance. <br /><br />I also loved all the representation in this book! As a member of the LGBTQIA+ community I’m always thrilled to see well written queer characters. Especially in fantasy! <br /><br />Additionally, we see characters with physical disabilities. Including a main character, which is not common. <br /><br />Each character is a well rounded being with complex emotions, motivations, and backgrounds. I felt like I got to know each of them! <br /><br />I listened to the Audiable and the narrator did a great job. She spoke a little slowly for me but once I put it at 1.5x it was great. Sometimes the voices were hard to tell a part. And Lettle’s voice was not my favorite. But mostly I really enjoyed the narration. <br /><br />What held this back from 5 stars for me is that it was a bit slow. I also felt like the climax of the story didn’t have enough punch. "

It’s extremely diverse, set in a queer normative world, there’s politics, romance, disability representation, cool animals and tons of magic. <br /><br />We follow two sisters who are elves, one is exiled and of course the other follows her. They’re are captured by fae and are freaking out because the fae and humans haven’t been seen in a long time. The two sisters are now in fae territory thrown into fae court and politics. Everything they thought they knew they’re are realizing they really didn’t know the whole truth and maybe they myths they were taught are actually very true and hold keys meanings. <br /><br />This romantasy was super fun to read, it was a bit predictable at times but overall I really enjoyed the story and will definitely read the next book in the series."

The representation of queer, dark skinned, genderfluid, and disabled characters is so welcome (especially for this genre) and felt natural and well integrated. For these reasons I really wanted this book to stand out in the genre, but sadly it ultimately didn’t. The deeper I got into the book, the more the writing felt clumsy, the plot predictable (SO predictable I wanted to shake the supposedly smart main character and shout THINK), and the romances corny and heatless. More and more tropes cropped up. It felt like the author lost steam. My immersion broke on almost every page. At the end of it all, I just didn’t care for this story much. "

      "review": "Hmmm. This rating feels very low, but as always, I have to go with my heart, and I'm not sure I got what I wanted out of this? Though if you asked me to describe what I'd been expecting, I'd be hard pressed, because I picked this up purely based on vibes, and the fact that I wanted to also read this author's debut trilogy. It's a fantasy about two elven sisters who end up in the forgotten fae realm. I'm seeing it described a lot as a fantasy romance, but I don't know if I agree? Both sisters do have relationships, both of which are intertwined in the story, but I still don't know if I'd describe this as a romance. Especially when I think of other fantasy romances where the relationship really is the focus.<br /><br />It's a very interesting world that flips a lot of the expected tropes on their heads. I like that our main characters are elves, the most numerous race in the world, while humans and fae are part of myth and legend. It's a neat little twist, and I liked the history and lore of the gods as described by the characters. The overarching plot deals with an age-old war between different factions of elves, and it's fine, if a little run-of-the-mill. There also some mystery and court intrigue that wasn't too difficult to figure out, but it kept me engaged. I liked both main characters a lot, but to be honest, I wish this had been a book that focused on one of the sisters, rather than both. Even though they're together most of the time, and their stories happen alongside each other, it feels like neither of them got the chance to really develop? It feels like we get half a story for each of them. IMO this might have worked better if this book had concentrated on Lettle and her romance with Rayan, and if the next book, for example, picked up with Yeeran and Furi. Or vice versa, whatever. Having the two of them in one book ended up feeling half-done.<br /><br />I also found myself getting irritated at the characters for kinda silly reasons. <input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"spoiler__control\" aria-label=\"The following text has been marked spoiler. Toggle checkbox to reveal or hide.\" onchange=\"this.labels[0].setAttribute('aria-hidden', !this.checked);\" id=\"3dd8227d-33cf-450d-9b47-9b2ca33674f2\" /><label aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"spoiler\" for=\"3dd8227d-33cf-450d-9b47-9b2ca33674f2\">Like, it might have been intentional or not, I don't know. But I really wanted Yeeran to take more responsibility? Salawa is obvious bad news; the author not-so-subtly clues us into that by letting us know she's A-okay with children in the military. So I'm glad that Yeeran is taking off her mental blinders and seeing Salawa for who she is. But on the flip side, everyone keeps acting like Salawa exiling Yeeran was a bad thing, and not a justified punishment for disobeying orders and getting almost 400 soldiers killed. The fact that everyone kept squirming away from that kinda ticked me off. Same for Yeeran killing the prince. Obviously she didn't mean to do it, and that should definitely be taken into account, but I don't know, there wasn't enough contrition and I didn't like it!<br /><br />And, see, I reread what I just wrote and it does seem like a really silly reason to get mad at a fictional character, but I'd be lying if I said it didn't affect my enjoyment. Same with Lettle's approach to some of their problems. I loved how headstrong she was, but the single-minded way she approached some of their problems wasn't always my favourite. <br /><br />Both romances were cute, but I didn't love either of them. Furi and Yeeran had all the ingredients of a ship I'd be absolutely feral about, but for an enemies to lovers arc as intense as this? It needed to be waaaaaay more slow burn, seriously. Yeeran literally killed her brother. This book should have just been about them training and bickering and slowly understanding each other and Yeeran learning more about the obeah (that bonding thing was interesting, though the word 'obeah' or animals kept throwing me off) and maaaaaybe sharing an intense look or touch a few times. Instead they got together AND had a breakup. It moved too quickly to be satisfying. Lettle and Rayan are cute, but I am BONE TIRED of the same old 'I have a secret that I should probably tell my love interest but in order to draw out the plot, I won't!' schtick.</label><br /><br />And I find myself with not much else to say. The writing was fine; not my favourite. Another silly thing that bugged me was that I hated how all the chants and prophecies were phrased. And this needed a better punctuation edit.<br /><br />Listened to the audiobook as read by Bahni Turpin and I liked it...? Mostly. Sometimes, while listening, I would think to myself that I really didn't like Lettle, and that she was so annoying, but then I'd stop and take stock. I actually loved Lettle and how headstrong she is, but I HATED the voice Turpin gave her, alas. It was really grating. But otherwise, the voices were good and the accents were serviceable. I'll probably continue the series because the plot intrigued me enough to keep going? But this wasn't the best start, for me."

The characters have a lot of life, depth and personality, and once that came out, I was engaged in their stories, I just wish it had happened earlier. I don’t think I was really invested until the last 100 pages or so.<br /><br />Also, the romance didn’t quite click for me, and I think this goes back to the dialogue- it just didn’t quite feel like the characters knew each other that well or were coming together out of anything except “mutual hotness”. Very Insta-lovey, which isn’t my cup of tea. <br /><br />Overall, think the best part was the way the author built the world through the use of small details and side characters that made the world feel full of life and not one-dimensional. Also love the diverse representation. <br /><br />I didn’t dislike this book by any means, but it never really captured me or gave me that “I can’t put this down” feeling. Underwhelming, but not bad. Will I read the next one? Probably. Would I recommend it? Eh, maybe."

      "review": "Faebound <br /><br />4/5⭐️<br /><br />“Yeeran was born on the battlefield, lived on the battlefield, and one day, she knew, she’d die on the battlefield.”<br /><br />This book tells the story of Elf siblings Yeeran and Lettle as their whole world and beliefs are turned upside down when they discover that the fae still exist. There are multiple character POVs throughout the book offering unique perspectives into each character and their individual personality and experiences. This is an adult fantasy that has a touch of spice towards the end however there is a fiery attraction between Yeeran and another character that leaves you wanting to read more about them and their enemies to lovers romance. I also love how the main characters are generally older around their 30s! So refreshing!! <br /><br />Yeeran and Lettle characters were interesting to read about and see their progression as individuals and siblings as they are both very similar and yet so very different. Both FMCs are strong, independent and determined and I love how both of their characters changed and developed throughout the book and they become better versions of themselves by the end. <br /><br />The author also explores gender fluidity and various romances seamlessly and beautifully within the book. This is also made easier with the book containing “notes” at the back with each characters pronouns. <br /><br />However the book felt a bit rushed and the timeline felt too hurried at times. I also was a bit disappointed that some of the tension and plot twists had been resolved at the end of the book? It was still left on a small cliff hanger however it doesn’t make me immediately want to look up when the second book will be released and see if I can preorder it. In saying that I still couldn’t put the book down and smashed it out in two days because despite some flaws it was a good and enjoyable read! <br />"

I liked a couple of things, but disliked most others. I just don’t think Faebound was for me.<br /><br />To start positively, I was originally excited to read this military fantasy romance because I was looking forward to a new fae series (plus the cover is gorgeous!). I was initially very drawn in by the prologue, the wealth of representation and culture, and drumfire, which I thought was a really unique fighting style/form of magic. The obeah (these magical bonding animals) were also really cool, but I quickly found that I was much more interested in them than the main characters.<br /><br />This brings me to my issues with the book, most of which revolve around the writing of the characters. For one, the dialogue and actions of the characters were so juvenile; I wouldn’t mind if this was YA, but Faebound is an adult fantasy novel and the characters often acted or talked like they were teenagers. This also caused the romances to feel very quick and unrealistic, led by jealousies and pure attraction rather than actual feelings and connections. I noticed myself sighing practically every other page at the lack of maturity - this included the moment I physically cringed when the author wrote one of the main characters describing sex as “doing the in and out,” which I don’t think anyone over 10 years old has ever said. <br /><br />I did have additional problems with the book, including the endless confusing metaphors, but I won’t spend my time going too in-depth. Since this was an ARC and I had reached about 50% before I really considered DNFing the book, I decided to finish it - but don’t feel like you need to. Personally, I would not recommend this fantasy book. There are so many other romantasy series out there with much more compelling stories, characters, romances, etc. I do hate writing bad reviews, but this book was really a struggle to get through."

      "review": "This was a solid Fantasy book, and a solid Sapphic Fantasy. <br />I am not sure I would categorize it as a Romantasy though, even though there was some romance portions. <br /><br />In this book there are three Gods, and those three gods had three children, Fae, Elves, and Humans. <br />\"All shall perish lest all three thrive.\"<br /><br />This book had all the elements of books I've been seeing lately. There are elements of choosing your own gender, freedom of sexuality, with the Fae you can have multiple sexual partner, and you don't even have to raise your own children, there are animal soul bonds, drum fire, divination, prophesies and there is a forever war among the Elves that had a lot of political classism elements to it. Two Tribes who seem to be fighting over resources and just the fact that they've always been at war they will never stop being at war. Oh and most importantly there are sisters, who would do anything for each other. <br /><br />When it came to the love interests, I wasn't really sold on either one of them, they felt rushed and didn't feel solid to me. I wasn't rooting for them if that makes sense. <br /><br />The book was fun to read, but around the middle, it got a little bit drawn out. <br /><br />-Characters- <br />Yeeran the older sister was a solider inside and out, but I felt like she should have been smarter in some parts of the book, rather than fawning over someone. This is my only critic of that portion. <br />Leetle the younger sister who has learned the power of Divination. I liked her a little more than the older sister but again I felt like she should have been focusing more on her situation rather than trying to not love someone. <br />These are things that I have to put on the back burner of my review though because this is a romance/fantasy. <br />Pila however has my heart for ever and ever. She was so cute and I loved her so much. <br />Golan reminded me heavily of China from the hunger games, I am going to assume that is who this character was based on, and if it's not I will be REALLY surprised.<br /><br />One other minor issue, is I saw some of the things coming from a mile away and I wanted some more surprise plot twists. I wanted the prophesies to be a little less obvious as well. <br /><br />The world building wasn't exhausting which I appreciate more than I can express, while it wasn't extensive, I got enough of it to understand what's happening and why. <br /><br />I will be reading the next book, and I am glad I read this one, it was enjoyable. I'm not going to say it was the best book of the year, but it was good. <br /><br />Thank you Net Galley for the Arc Approval. <br />"

This is real pathetic lesbian girlfailure representation, which is important too.<br /><br />That said, the world-building is quite interesting. It depends in large part on pre-established fantasy tropes like race wars between humans/elves/fae, apocalyptic prophecies, and monarchic governments, but I liked the concept of a soul bond between a person and an animal. Kind of like The Golden Compass. I can see why the romantasy girlies love it."

It felt original and not like it was trying to imitate other certain popular fantasy books 👀 I found parts of the book to be cozy and enjoyable as just slice of life before returning to the plot which was refreshing!<br />I loved that there was diversity in the characters as well and the main characters are sisters. Lettle was my favorite probably because she had the most distinct personality. I liked Keeran but I felt like her arc was messy largely due to her romance which I’ll get to later. The plot was predictable and I would’ve liked a little more mystery but it was still enjoyable.<br /><br />The biggest issue I had in the book was actually the romance which was surprising to me since I love fantasy romance. The relationships just did not work for me at all and felt rushed. Lettle and Rayan were way too insta love. They share their family trauma around a fire and then are deeply in love? Is this freshman orientation?<br />Keeran and Furi while I appreciate them being lesbians seemingly had nothing in common other than thinking the other was really hot. I don’t believe that would be enough for me to get over someone even accidentally murdering my brother but you do you Furi. I would’ve preferred for Keeran to come to some understanding about her previous relationship with Salawa other than “oh wait maybe I didn’t actually love her.” I think it’s because the author wants to introduce the concept of mates which would make me dislike these romances even more. <br /><br />I think the romances would have been better being hinted to in this book and built up through the series.<br />I will most likely read the other books in the series because I do want to know what happens! <br />"

Yeeran’s younger sister Lettle is practicing magical prophecies - divinations - giving her sister the prophecy causing a fatal mistake for her regiment, Yeeran is exiled from all Elven Lands. When she kills a magical creature, the sisters’ lives will change forever. <br /><br />I liked the concept of this book so much but the execution just wasn’t there. This was a rough draft. The writing was monotone and robotic, very matter of fact, we are being told everything without much showing. Many scenes and conversations seem to wrap up immediately. There is no depth or development to the characters and the world building is sadly very minimal.<br /><br />I appreciated the queer and diverse representation, I think this book was marketed as romantasy, but neither romance was believable due to the style of writing and lack of character development, you didn’t care that much about these characters. <br /><br />The magical elements and the Obeah creatures were unique but not explored like I had hoped. Ultimately this book was missing intrigue, mystery, that important story structure, and overall the epic-ness suggested in the synopsis. Even though more action happens in the third part of the book than in the first two. <br /><br />Few plot choices bothered me or didn’t make much sense. This is an adult novel, Yeeran is 34 and Lettle 28 - both women are written much younger and immature. Yeeran makes two of the biggest offenses, where many people die, but gets away with a slap on the wrist each time. Seemingly without any remorse the whole thing is swept away, it left me feeling odd throughout the remainder of the book. <br /><br />Thanks to NetGalley and Del Rey for an early copy to review."

I thought the representation of disabilities was done well - none of the 'disabled character gets more powers so they're basically not disabled anymore' bullshit you often see (especially in high fantasy), and it was also never a plot point. Simply disabled characters in a story that's not about disability, so props there. Also the representation and diversity was really good - again, just trans, non-binary, and queer characters existing in the world. However, I did think the story was a bit plot twist heavy and while some of the reveals were well executed, a lot more of them were pretty obvious which meant it didn't feel satisfying when we finally reached them or I was actively annoyed at characters for not realising certain things sooner. It was also a bit tropey for my liking and subsequently sometimes bordered on feeling like fanfic, but maybe that's just why I don't typically read romantasy lol. Anyway, I have no doubt this is better than ACOTAR (...not that I have read or ever will read it) and is definitely more diverse than it, so if you are into the genre, I would happily recommend this, and I'll probably end up reading the rest of the trilogy when it comes out."

The story telling, the world building, the characters, all of it was utter perfection.

This has been my first read by this author and it’s definitely made me consider their other work- it was hard to put this down but at the same time I didn’t want it to end. "

      "review": "I absolutely ATE THIS UP. Some amazing displays of representation that didnt feel like afterthoughts or anything, just part of the world and normalised: disability representation, queer representation, a queer FMC that doesn't have the whole \"turned straight for MMC\" trope going on, some sweet romance and hesitancy as a sub-plot that didn't take away from the main plot, and some really refreshing new takes on the concept of fae that made this book feel new, unique and kept me hooked.<br /><br />ONLY reason I'm not reviewing 5 stars is because I feel like a few parts of the book were rushed pacing-wise, with a few bombshells dropped pretty quickly and almost outta left field, which I wish we'd had more time to explore and work up to, dance around a little and build a little more tension so those reveals would be a little more mind-blowing. I would also have loved some more time to immerse myself in the story and relationships between characters and explore the world-building of Mosima more. I'm not sure if this is me just saying I wish the book had been longer - there would be more of these wonderful MCs to read about, and more book for me to devour! Sometimes it reads as though SE-A just got VERY excited to finish the chapter and reach the next big exciting part or the next phase of the story without giving it the fleshing-out, length and complexity these moments and characters truly deserved, which I completely understand as a writer tbh, but the pacing did take me out of it a tiny bit when I got to the book's climactic moments.<br /><br />The story was wonderful and I really enjoyed it, and I hope book 2 has a little expansion on world-building and character relationships and the complexities between our MCs a little more. Otherwise, no notes, and a really enjoyable read that I devoured in one sitting 😅"

The world is unique and the magic a twist on obeah which was joy to experience. <br /><br />But, it promises much and delivers little. It is a very slow start. I almost DNF’d and it takes about 100 pages to get going. It is mostly telling, not showing, and I found it difficult to immerse myself in the story because of it. <br /><br />The relationship between Yeeran and Furi switches from enemies to lovers in the span of about 2 pages. It gave me whiplash. It didn’t make sense. <br /><br />These characters are supposed to all be in their late 20s/early 30s yet their decisions and reactions are not realistic for someone in those age ranges. There are a few spicy scenes which, if excluded, I could forgive the novel’s immaturity for being YA, but it’s not. This is an adult novel. <br /><br />Now let’s look at the spice. It was totally unnecessary. It didn’t move the story on, I didn’t feel more connected to the characters because of it. We had two scenes from our gay couple, but the other hetro relationship was a fade to black. That doesn’t make sense. It felt fetishised which detracted from where this novel did succeed."

Like one second Yeeran and Furi are watching the fire be put out by the chalice’s and the next second they are fucking in the woods. I do think this book shows a wonderful representation of queer characters but the relationships moved fast as well. Furi had such an intense hatred for Yeeran and that melted away so quickly. I also felt no chemistry between Lettle and Rayan. Lettle honestly just annoyed me. <br /><br />This story is good and I think the author ended it in such a good way that makes me excited for the next book. I just hope the next one is better written.

It would be spelled out for us in the prophecies but somehow the characters couldn’t put it together? I also would not say this is a romantasy. Was there lust and attraction? Yes. Was there romance? Definitely not. Neither relationship had any real buildup, they just happened and they happened way too quickly.

But as it got closer to 100 things started to go bad for me. <br /><br />This book has representation, I love that. I want more diversity in the books I read so I was happy that within the first two chapters so many representations were checked off. Not only sexual, sexuality, but also a disability of a main character. But that’s what it felt like, things being checked off for the sake of it. It seemed to matter in the moment.. and then seemed to get a few mentions but I didn’t feel like it fully went anywhere. <br /><br />Let’s talk about the tropes, these also felt like they were being ticked off for the sake of it. One bed, check. But there was nothing the tropes added. They just feel flat for me and felt like they were added for the sake of it. <br /><br />I found the drum magic interesting as well as the lore of how the three races were started. <br /><br />But some of the dialogue felt choppy and unrefined. In my head I found myself adjusting and correcting it, which is never a good sign. <br /><br />The love interests and the relationships in this were cringey and tropey. I just didn’t like it, some of the scenes felt misplaced with the plot. <br /><br />The big twist came, and I saw it from a mile away. I would have loved to have less hinting at it. It could have been this huge thing, but the lead up stole the surprise. <br /><br />Overall I wanted to love this book.. but I just didn’t. One day I will read Final Strife because I do want to give this author another chance. "

I couldn’t put this book down. <br /><br />From the care shown to not only gender and sexuality, but to race, and disability. This book had it all. The struggles of political and moral discourse. The discrimination against those who are different. The devastation brought on by war. The struggles of what is right and what is just. The author did an amazing job. It was absolutely fantastic. <br /><br />This book was very war focused, with a few different love stories between multiple POV’s. I really enjoyed having the multiple view points. The way they intertwined with each other between the timeline of events was beautifully done. <br /><br />My favorite character was Lettle. She was treated like a child, she was put down, but she was so incredibly strong. She showed everyone what she was made of. I love her character so much. <br /><br />If you loved fourth wing and the banter with the characters and their dragon familiars then you’ll loveeeeee this book! <br /><br /><br />I did personally struggle with one of the TW’s, the malnutrition and starvation aspect that was brought up multiple times during the book. As someone who was starved and malnourished to the point of almost dying it brought up a lot of emotions for me, that I thought I had worked through. There was a particular moment in the book about half way through that hit me hard. I don’t know if the author has ever had to also go through a situation where they were starved and malnourished but they wrote like they knew exactly what someone who’s been through that would say and feel. It didn’t feel mocking, it didn’t feel like it was an after thought. The emotions that were expressed while discussing those things were present. And accurate. <br /><br />As hard as it was for me emotionally I hope it puts into perspective for some people who have never been through something like that, that they can imagine the difficulties and trauma it causes someone. How often that trauma pops up. And how words about food, and eating can affect the people around you without you even realizing it. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />A mix of Tropes, and TW’s just to name a few -<br />found family, enemies to lovers, familiars, murder, death, war, starvation/malnourishment, friends to lovers, WW, MM, MW, disability representation, discrimination, gore, animal death, descriptive language of desecration of animal remains, hunting, confinement. <br /><br /><br />"

      "review": "Faebound . . . More like the Fucking Bane of my Existence<br /><br />Rating: 1 / 5 stars<br /><br />Disclaimer: This was a book club book that I did not select myself. I would not have read this for any reason outside of friendship. And my experience validated my understanding of my tastes. This should have been a DNF by page 25. <br /><br />Plot: An absolute whirlwind- events sped by at ten times speed. It consistently felt like the author was following a checklist of scenes to shove into this book (ie ‘only one bed trope’, magical library, training montages, faery orgies) without successfully developing them into the plot. This created a jilted experience between the actions and the characters and their emotions. <br /><br />Characters: These simply did not exist for me. They were so bland the details faded from my mind and left a vague impression behind: Lettle, the clumsy rude one and Yeeran, the horny bloodthirsty one. There were multiple instances that left me confused by the character’s thoughts not aligning with what I was told to expect from them or their actions. <br />Yerevan felt significantly more guilty for murdering a few obeah and their faery counterparts than she did for leading 376 of her own soldiers to slaughter (and who knows how many thousand before this book started). Make this make sense? Please?<br />Lettle continuously claims she is the only elf invested in their freedom and planning their escape from Mosima. However, she also ridicules her sister’s distrust and suspicion of Komi. <br /><br />Dialogue: The issue that caused me to close this book nearly every 5 pages was the dialogue. The short sentences were not to my taste and the book relied a lot on dialogue. Examples:<br />“Are your muscles made of stone?” she seethed. <br />“Nerad . . . eh . . . can you see that, or have I been practicing magesight for too long and I’m hallucinating?’ <br />“What . . . do you want me to ride you?”<br />“You’ve been sleeping with Berro. Having sex with her. Making love. Doing the in and out. Whatever you want to call it.”<br />“Argh,” she screamed at the sea. <br />“Let us part in anger, because I cannot part in love, it hurts too damn much.”<br /><br /><br /><br />Relationships: Zero chemistry. The sex scenes were oddly repetitive? I simply could not care at all. Even the supposed sisters did not give me a single reason to believe they cared about each other. <br /><br />Worldbuilding: Bland. I appreciated the map page and the newts on it. The use of myth as the beginnings of the separate parts was also a nice touch however the world itself was lackluster and stereotypical. I’ve read many of these concepts before, done better. Most notably I struggled with the random animal/human bonding and the lack of depth that came with it after having read Robin Hobb’s Farseer trilogy. <br /><br />Writing: Not good. I like ellipses, probably more than I should, but even I can tell that this book used way too many. I was surprised to find out this was not the author’s debut, which covers my thoughts on the writing. Some parting examples:<br />“ soldiers were the worst kind of people. They were all self-serving nationalists, hungry for power and violence. Except Yeeran, of course.”<br />“He wields his jawline like a weapon.”<br />“if she just stretched a little more, she’d collide with Rayan’s . . . parts.”<br /><br />Maybe I was just not in the mood, or the right headspace to give this book its best shot and plenty of people seemed to enjoy it, so take my review for what it is: my opinion, and go read whatever you feel drawn to. <br />"

Lettle was so SO incredibly annoying, I wish I'd skipped more of her dialogue, and her romance with Rayan was pulled out of thin air. It's like the author really wanted us to think that there was something there but I never felt it. All of the romance really just wasn't it. <br /><br />I also really dislike it when a book has no ending!!! It's fine, give me a bit of a cliffhanger, but I want to feel good about finishing a book and this left a terrible taste in my mouth.

Not for me.<br /><br />Some moments that made me say \"ughhhh\" out loud:<br /><br />Yeeran possibly apologizing a million times per chapter about what happened because of the obeah she killed. WE GET IT! You didn't know... Everyone close to the death is way too nice about it. Oh you naive little elf, it's ok, you didn't know, all is forgiven. What?? I needed more of them to be upset.<br /><br />Lettle: <i>\"He chuckled, and somehow it sounded like rain shower\".</i> Excuse me???<br /><br />And Lettle always so desperately wanting to leave even though she was so unhappy!

Lettle, her sister and practitioner of divination, wants nothing more than for her sister to leave the army and find a new purpose. When Yeeran is exiled, tossed aside by her elven people, she must find a new path. Determined to earn back her honor, she tracks and kills an obeah--a magical beast that is used to make drumskin for weapons of the army. Unfortunately, Yeeran kills more than an obeah and ends up as a prisoner alongside her sister and former captain. The bigger problem? Their captors shouldn't exist.<br /><br />I LOVED this one so much. There's a unique magic/combat system, well-defined characters, and prose that is reminiscent of Tolkien. We have politics, we have world building, we have sassy secondary magical creatures. We have a romantic subplot that is relevant to the story, but it is not THE story--fantasy romance more so than romantasy. I actually didn't see some of the twists coming, but they weren't totally out of left field.

      "review": "Is this book perfect? No. Is it the best book I've read? No. But I had a really fun time reading it. It is an actual enemies to lovers book which is so hard to come by. It's a book that is centered around sisterly love and facing what you were taught and how that might be incorrect and facing that head on. It's a fantasy book that is filled with queer characters just existing but have complex morals. <br /><br />It is not a book that is for fourth wing and acotar lovers in my opinion. There is no romance for most of the book and there is very little smut. Which doesn't bother me, but know that going in. It leans more on the slow born kind of things, but there isn't a crazy high paced sex scene at the end. I do like how the sex scenes were written. After reading books like acotar and fourth wing it's refreshing to read a SAPPHIC tender love scene. It's not the window shattering scenes you get in fourth wing, but rather two characters who have finally realized despite them thinking they hated each other, they really care for each other. <br /><br />That being said there were some parts of this book I did not like. I know people have commented on pacing and I agree. I think having a big scene in the first 40 pages that is supposed to have ripple affects throughout the story before characters are really established isn't the greatest. I wished that there had been more lead up with Salawa before what kick starts the story. Also more of an establishment of the sister relationship. I felt some of the weight, but it was hard for me to really have a reaction or care when we had just met the characters. <br /><br />I am going to be so real, I can't stand Lettle. I hope she grows as the series goes on because every time I got to her chapter I rolled my eyes. I wish that her and Rayan's romance was more of a build up. Even though I love Furi and Yeeran I think their's could've taken a little longer too. <br /><br />I do think I'll continue reading the series because I really do like the world, most of the characters and the plot. I don't think this will be my favorite read of the year like I thought it would be. "

      "review": "Disappointed as previous works from this author had given me an inflated sense of her writing ability that Faebound just fell short of the mark. This felt like it was intended as an adult romantasy inspired by Holly Black’s Folk of the Air series - which I love- but for an author who has demonstrated a penchant for writing adult military fantasy epics this was such a letdown. Perhaps this series is better intended for young adult or romantasy readers looking to expand their reading tastes into adult literature with more constructed plots, worlds, and characters thereby bridging them into books like the Final Strife. <br /><br />While I love the cover art for Faebound (and all their variants) I definitely did not like the story. Incorporating all the romance aspects felt forced and abrupt. There was definitely a point about three quarters of the way through that despite the numerous obstacles the main characters have asserted for not succumbing to their respective romances they become the principle driving actions for the remainder of the story along with all the cringeworthy dialogue that accompanies these corny developments. On top of that absurdity I absolutely hated Lettle and her POV. I never connected to her character and found her chapters to be rife with contradictory behaviors and annoyingly self-inflated inner dialogues. The prophecies were her only contribution to the plots and those could have been emitted as they were not only obvious lacking any added suspense but also completely irrelevant when it came to these prophesied events unfolding. If nothing is altered with the addition of a character or a power except to inject a sense of foreboding that didn’t even manage that then there was no point in that making it into the final story (other than for the obvious hetero cis romance to attract all the girlies not pulled in by the allure of sapphic love / hate tropes). The final chapters have convinced me that the sequel story could be more of the developed read I was hoping for and revived my intentions to continue on with the series. "

The only reason I'm not giving it a full 5 stars is that the pacing felt a bit too slow at times, but I was otherwise so enraptured by Faebound ❤️ <br /><br />This book had it all - a great mix of magic, politics, war, mythology, prophecies, sisterhood, romance and magical companions. All wrapped up with a really beautiful writing style that made this world come alive on paper and kept me captivated chapter after chapter! Oh, and a delightfully queernormative world with a very fluid approach to gender. <br /><br />Faebound is a dual-POV adult fantasy set in a world where 3 races used co-exist, elves, faes and humans, but only elves are believe to have survived. When the elven colonel Yeeran is exiled for a military mistake, her sister Lettle (a diviner) follows her straight away, despite all the dangers they might encounter. And unexpected dangers they sure do encounter: the fae! Not so extinct as they though and very much intending to hold the captives forever! Everything Yeeran and Lettle thought they knew, everything they believed... it all needs to be reconsidered and their loyalties and hearts are tested aplenty. <br /><br />The two protagonists are both incredibly interesting and kickass. They love each other so deeply and their bond is so beautiful to read about. Their relationships with others around them are complex and really realistic - from friendships, to romances and enemies. I particularly loved the way Yeeran's friendship with her captain Rayan is portrayed, as well as her true-enemies-to-lovers sapphic romance. <br /><br />I also loved the world-building in this novel: the magic system, the land of the Faes, the mythology, the magical bond with the Obeah. The Obeah!! They were definitely a highlight for me, alongside the interesting use of prophecies and myths to advance the story. Some of the prophecies were admittedly quite predictable to solve, but I enjoyed the way the characters reached their understanding. <br /><br />Anyway, I'd highly recommend this to any fantasy reader and I can't wait for the sequel to be announced."

All opinions are my own.<br /><br />If you’re looking for a romantasy that diversifies your shelf this is it. A fantasy inspired by African mythology with an incredibly unique magic system. Sapphic romance and gender fluid representation. A world with three gods and three people; fae, elves and humans. A forever war that will continue until all three can unite. Our FMC is an elf, a colonel in the Forever War who has grown up in a world where fae and human have been eradicated. Rival clans of elves continue in a war for power and land. This book starts off strong as a war based fantasy and quickly transports the reader into the unknown world where our main characters discover that their world is much larger than it seemed and that their history may be richer than they realize. Multiple magic types; drum magic, divination, sun magic, and talking bonded magical animal companions. Absolutely loved this story and cannot wait for the continuation of this series. "

      "review": "If you like romantasy and want something queer, you'll probably enjoy this a lot.<br />If you're looking for some epic fantasy, lots of fae lore and deep political intrigue, you may be disappointed.<br /><br />I can see what's to like, when you like that kind of thing. It's a romance-driven story in an elves &amp; fae queernormative world with cute animal-like bonds. It's well written and pulls you in and keeps you reading... up to a certain point.<br />For me, I was really intrigued, was immersed for a time, but ultimately couldn't get behind any of the romances. We've got sapphic enemies-to-lovers where they're enemies for a bit then somehow fall in love out of nowhere. The other romance doesn't have anything special either...<br />I guess I would have liked more lore, more fantasy, more politics (and this comes from someone who doesn\"t read that much fantasy...), more sibling bonds.<br /><br />Maybe I wasn't in the mood, maybe it wasn't for me, but this book just didn't do anything to surprise or make me care for the characters or the world enough to care about what could have been an epic fantasy story about bad ass warrior women.<br /><br />I talk about books here: <a href=\"https://linktr.ee/eloise_bradbooks\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Instagram</a> / <a href=\"https://linktr.ee/eloise_bradbooks\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">TikTok</a> / <a href=\"https://linktr.ee/eloise_bradbooks\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Linktree</a>"

If your looking for an honest and open minded review of Faebound, keep reading xx<br /><br /><br />i liked faebound, i didn’t love it. i felt like the writing was super formal and that’s just not my vibe, however there was some great elements too, i really liked the inclusivity and the many forms of relationships, i liked the layers to the world the author has created, world building is real easy to follow. i liked the depth to the characters and the individual struggles they all go through. <br />i feel like there was a lot of flatness to this boon despite it having such a full on world, there was definitely times where it could’ve had more going on. i also would’ve like to see less stiffness to the relationship between Furi and Yeeran. <br />i feel like a lot people went into this thinking it was going to be the next ACOTAR, and if that is your thought process then pls throw that away bc it’s absolutely not. <br />this book would be great for someone with an open mind, who loves a good multi pov, enjoys a more formal writing style, and is looking for some sapphic representation."

Yeeran's romance was instant love, and that is just not my cup of tea. <br /><br />I Liked the inclusivity in this book, the gender fluidity and sapphic romance were done really well.<br /><br />Overall It was an enjoyable read and I will most likely continue with the series."

It was slow, plot holes everywhere and boring. The Sapphic elf angle was different. The sisterly bond story was okay. This just was not the book for me. However representation matters and I know many who will enjoy this book. I just found the romance lacking and I was not engaged with the characters or the story line. Honestly I wish the author the best in preorders and sales. I think this will be well received by others but it was just not for me."

      "review": "I was excited to read this book when it was recommended to me at Chapters. The cover says:<br /><blockquote>\"lesbian necromancers explore a haunted gothic palace in space!\"</blockquote><br />After finishing the book, I realized you can't judge a book by its cover<br /><br />As the author has written on this site in response to a question about \"how much LGBTQ content there is in the book?\":<br /><blockquote> \"It's hard to quantify how much LGBT content is in the book -- the plot contains arguably very little romance, and conflicts/issues surrounding being LGBTQIA+ don't come up at all and never will. Hilariously, the word 'lesbian' comes up in the blurb but is never used in the book.\"</blockquote><br />Hilarious. It's hilarious that the author permitted a misleading (queerbaiting) quote to grace the cover of her book. I mean, the lesbian character is not a necromancer.<b> Did Charles Stross even read this book?</b> Chai's excellent review on this site said that the blurb gave her a \"bellyful of false hope\", and I must agree. <br /><br />The book is marketed as having this LGBTQIA+ representation, but nothing about Gideon's character other than her checking out other women is coded as a lesbian/queer experience. The character Gideon says \"bitch\", \"douche\" \"dickhead\", \"numbnuts\" a LOT. So, it's like, Oh? She is a butch lesbian with a (toxic masc.) sailor's mouth? Zzzz<br /><br />Second, and to me, this point is pretty much unforgivable: Any character that /may/ be BIPOC is described as \"brown\". Is Jeannemary sun-worn, or am I to understand her being described as a \"brown brick \" with \"corrugated hair\" is an attempt at describing a BIPOC character? I mean, we have beautiful descriptions like blueberry-coloured and amethyst eyes, tawny limbs (is Coronabeth a BIPOC character?) and amber hair, but I have no idea if people are up in Canaan House representing the diversity of the human race, or if Gideon thinks anyone whose planet receives UV rays is “brown”.<br /><br />“Also, would-be writers, please avoid the term 'peanut gallery'. Oh, and adverbs”, the reviewer said wearily.<br /><br />Finally, the world building incongruities. The 4th wall is broken for me when Gideon remarks that the make-up she wears gives her “pizza face”. Do the vestal nuns of the 9th have pizza night? There are many, many instances of this kind of incongruity throughout the book, and unfortunately it always snaps me out of the story. The Nine houses concept is cool though. I just wish that when I turned to the back of the book for the glossary, more context about the houses, and pronunciations of the characters’ names, I didn’t get hit with the massive spoiler that <input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"spoiler__control\" aria-label=\"The following text has been marked spoiler. Toggle checkbox to reveal or hide.\" onchange=\"this.labels[0].setAttribute('aria-hidden', !this.checked);\" id=\"e76b2126-e149-413d-b1b4-8a0aba0863ba\" /><label aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"spoiler\" for=\"e76b2126-e149-413d-b1b4-8a0aba0863ba\">\n  <b>Gideon dies</b>\n</label>.<br /><br />All in all, I enjoyed the whodunnit aspect of the story, the concepts of necromantic theorems, the total embrace of gothic skeleton creepiness, <i>Bones with Dr. Skelebone</i>, and I find Gideon’s brash and simple go-get’em attitude refreshing! However, this book received a LOT of media attention and awards, and in my opinion it is not strong enough to have received those accolades. Readers, perhaps spend your hard-earned money (or tax dollars if you use the library!) engaging with fantasy that has robust LGBTQAI+ and BIPOC representation, and more sophisticated world-building."

      "review": "UPDATE: This book was just as engaging, if not more so, on a re-read. Already knowing the twisty-turny plot, I was free to focus more on the character development and relationship development between Gideon and Harrow, which was very rewarding. There were also some new things that I was able to pick up on after having read Harrow the Ninth. I love this book even more now.<br /><br />--<br /><br />\"But Gideon was also experiencing one powerful emotion: being sick of everyone's shit.\"<br /><br />This book was great! First and foremost, it had wonderfully interesting characters. I loved Gideon, I even loved Harrowhark. How many adventure fantasy novels have you read with a young protagonist who has a chip on their shoulder and just broods at the world? Bor-ing. I think that Gideon's unique-among-fantasy-protagonists personality makes this book stand out above the rest. Another important element, the relationships between characters, and how the relationships evolve over the course of the story is also excellently done. I enjoyed the essay about the Necromancer/Cavalier relationship in the back of the book, and I enjoyed the variety of examples of that relationship that the book presented. The setting of Necromancers In Space was quite unique and I enjoyed learning about all the different types of necromancy and magic. Finally, the plot was always moving, with plenty of mystery and action. Beware, it does have horror and violence. Because, y'know. Necromancy and stuff.<br /><br />So, yeah, between the (queer) characters, the relationships, the setting, the plot, and the action...this book pretty much has it all. I loved it!!!<br /><br />Representation notes: Main character is a queer woman. There's no textbook queer romance, but queer femme attraction plays a role in the story. Author is a lesbian.<br /><br />I could totally see this being adapted into a TV series someday."

      "review": "<i>This story was a thing with teeth; snapping at you at every chance it got, pulling and poking at you and just letting you rest long enough to feel safe, only for your sturdy lantern of hope to be crushed by giant bone monsters and gore alore.</i><br /><br /><b>4,5/5 Stars</b><br /><br /><b>Gideon Nav</b> is a swordswoman who wants nothing more than to be free of the shackles the Ninth House put on her at birth. <b>Harrowhark Nonagesimus</b> is a necromancer of the black-clad-with-creepy-personality type and is the secret ruler of the Ninth House. They both hate each other fiercely - and, unfortunately, they also need each other for their respective goals.<br /><br /><blockquote>\n  <b> “Nonagesimus,” she said slowly, “the only job I’d do for you would be if you wanted someone to hold the sword as you fell on it. The only job I’d do for you would be if you wanted your ass kicked so hard, the Locked Tomb opened and a parade came out to sing, ‘Lo! A destructed ass.’ The only job I’d do would be if you wanted me to spot you while you backflipped off the top tier into Drearburh.”<br />“That’s three jobs,” said Harrowhark.</b>\n</blockquote><br /><br />When the Emperor - the King Undying, their God - calls each of the Nine Houses of Dominicus in need of necromancers who are to become literal saints, Harrow needs a cavalier to accompany her. And so Gideon receives the offer to pose as Harrow's fake-cavalier and bodyguard for the duration of the trials, after which she would be allowed to flee the Ninth House at last. Sometimes you need to team up with your worst enemy in order to achieve success in your ambitions.<br /><br />They are summoned to <b>Canaan House</b> for the trials, meeting up with heirs from the remaining houses. With mere scraps of information tossed at them as to how they are supposed to become saints - Lyctors - of the Emperor, the narrative begins to follow Gideon as she explores Canaan House, its new inhabitants, and the dark secrets it holds. Soon you find yourself inmidst a gruesome mess of mysteries, dangers, death - and lots of face paint.<br /><br /><blockquote>\n  <b> “If you do not find yourself a galaxy, it is not so bad to find yourself a star.” </b>\n</blockquote><br /><br />Let me briefly begin this review by saying that yes, while this story has a bright and intense humor that left me wheezing out loud, it is horror. It is the most gruesome horror. This book will punch you in the guts and make your feel so sick you don't feel like eating for the next hour if you're too squeamish. I have included a rather detailed list of trigger warnings at the end of this review because I got into this underestimating the feelings this book would envoke, and while I personally loved it immensely, I wish for no one to go into this and not be prepared for what is to come.<br /><br />That aside, HOT DAMN. What a book!<br /><br />It is wonderfully Gothic and atmospheric, grabbing you by the throat and pulling you into its sea of mysteries, gore, and feelings of distrust. When the waves crash over your head still you feel like you want to dive deeper, you need to know what is down below, what the darkness holds. There are these bright and loveable characters and you want to hold them and trust them because they become so dear to you but there's always something off. You know they might betray you but you love each of them to bits nonetheless. I would read entire stories on some of these heirs and their cavaliers, although none were as intricate and delicate as Harrow and Gideon.<br /><br />The relationship of those two developed beautifully over the entire book. While they started off as each other's worst enemies, they became so much more by the end of the book. It felt very real and comforting to read about their relationship - not love, not friendship, but the development of their trust and partnership as cavalier and necromancer. A gorgeous, living breathing thing. Some chapters just felt like they had their own heartbeat, like you could feel it pulsating in these pages, their hearts in sync. It speaks to you and you listen because you love them and you want them to be okay because they've been through so much and they are in desperate need of a happy ending. And the ending of this book ended <i>me</i>.<br /><br /><blockquote>\n  <b> “Her adept said: \"I'll keep it off you. Nav, show them what the Ninth House does.\"<br />Gideon lifted her sword. The construct worked itself free of its last confines of masonry and rotten wood and heaved before them, flexing itself like a butterfly.<br />\"We do bones, motherfucker,\" she said.”</b>\n</blockquote><br /><br />This book was so funny. Something I'd have never expected from Horror Fiction like this. I've never read a book I found funnier at times - and it's HORROR. As a stylistic element this was genius! Characters died, there was so much pain and gore and depressive episodes and then - boom! The story made me hold my breath and then let me burst out laughing and it felt fantastic! It makes everything feel a little more okay; I was handed a hot cup of tea after coming home from a snowstorm and I get to enjoy my tea before the whole house crashes down on me again.<br /><br /><blockquote>\n  <b> \"This calls for rigor, Nav.\"<br />\"Maybe rigor... mortis,\" said Gideon, who assumed that puns were funny automatically.</b>\n</blockquote><br /><br />However, my biggest issue (and the reason why it's not 5 stars) is the wordbuilding. At the beggining I had trouble getting through the thick jargon of words and characters and places - the worldbuilding was inconsistent and left holes I could literally climb through. I felt like I was trying to swim through some particularily thick muddy swamp; I simply let everything happen and hoped the book would toss me a rope so I could pull myself forward. The author was so kind as to include lots of extra lore and information in the very back in the book - information I would have desperately needed at the beginning of the book in order to understand anything at all.<br /><br />Maybe halfway through the book it got much better - at least it felt that way - because it was more the characters who were mysteries and not the world itself. By then I was already head-over-heels obsessed and rushed through this story, losing my sense of time meanwhile. A truly wonderful experience.<br /><br /><blockquote>\n  <b> “Maybe it's that I find the idea comforting...that thousands of years after you're gone...is when you really live. That your echo is louder than your voice is.”</b>\n</blockquote><br /><br />I believe the pitch of \"lesbian necromancers in space\" is not the most accurate. While Gideon is most definitely gay (there is no question about that, considering her inner dialogue we get to read), there is no romance or conflicts that are influenced by the fact that she likes women. And the space part... yeah I think (and hope) that will play a bigger role in Harrow the Ninth (the sequel of this trilogy) but this book played solely on the planet of the Ninth House as well as Canaan House.<br /><br /><br /><i>Would I recommend this book? YES, but only if people seriously consider the trigger warnings below. I've loved this book and it was the perfect merge of great Gothic atmosphere, well-written horror, intriguing characters, moral conflicts, and proper stakes. Although I've written this review over the course of multiple hours, I still feel like my words don't do this story justice. Read it for yourself if you feel safe dong so! My heart is still bleeding and I can't wait for Harrow the Ninth!</i><br /><br /><br /><br /><b>TW: Graphic Descriptions of Violence, Pain and Death/Dying, Murder, Mass Murder, Near-Death Experience, Suicide (and conversations about suicide), Terminal Illness (Cancer), Blood, Loss of a Loved One, Gore, Child Abuse (kind of, mentioned), Death of Children, Grief Depiction, Talk of Depression, Self Harm (to get blood for necromantic magic), Decapitation, Impalement, Mutilation (Cutting of Limbs)</b>"

this was another one of the reasons i'd never warmed to gideon, but that's hardly her fault.]<br /><br />i have more feelings about gideon beyond that but i find myself not caring enough to type them out. and that, really, sums up my feelings for her: i found her frustrating (both in her writing and as a character) and simply just...not for me. so much to the point that i don't particularly care to even talk about her enough to get into why.<br /><br />4) harrow as a protagonist: in the beginning, i found harrow insufferable because of how she treated gideon. she got better as the book progressed. i actually really liked the revelation behind her conception, and then of her parents' death. i also really liked her specific subset of necromancy. my issue with her is mainly tied up in her romance with gideon, which i'll get to next. by the end of the book: i liked her more than gideon, but that's not saying much. i am still neutral toward her.<br /><br />5) griddlehark: yeah, fine. let me just turn in my lesbian card now. i did not like their romance. and it is not because they start off on a bad foot - not at all. my issue is i don't even understand why they like each other. specifically, i don't understand why gideon likes her. like, a chapter or two before they get together, gideon wants to betray harrow. she can't stand her, and rightfully so. harrow has treated gideon like garbage their lives - harrow even admits as much in her essentially-love-confession - but then....harrow, what? admits that the reason she did all that is because she actually hated herself and suddenly all is forgiven? why?<br /><br />like, genuinely, why? there are hints throughout the book that gideon does care more for harrow than she wants to believe. i get that. it did not go over my head. i still thought the confession scene and their get-together was completely fucking stupid. that is the only way i can describe it. <br /><br />okay, let's break from subjective opinion for a second.<br /><br />objectively, gideon and harrow's relationship had a power imbalance. gideon was her <i>indentured servant</i>. she says in the beginning of the book that she owns her. she says she brought gideon with her to the first house<i>as her slave</i>. this is never addressed. oh, sorry. let me correct that. it is briefly addressed, before they even leave the ninth house. gideon says something like, \"you don't own me\" because i guess, like, just saying so makes it so, right? that's how power dynamics work now, apparently.<br /><br />no lol - this is never brought up in any meaningful way. gideon never had a genuine choice about being brought to the first house. she was forced into it. it does not matter how gideon personally feels about it, because that is literally fact. the ninth house owned gideon. gideon would not be able to leave the ninth house or harrow's side without her explicit permission. she could try (and that's how the book even starts!) but she always runs the risk of being caught and brought back.<br /><br />and this is my issue: harrow made gideon's life hell because she hated why she - harrow, that is - was alive, and what it meant. she calls herself a war crime. but throughout their entire relationship, she had power over gideon. gideon's initial hatred for harrow, and harrow's misplaced hatred for gideon were never on equal footing. they just fucking weren't. and this is never addressed; harrow confesses her love, gideon hugs her. all is forgiven.<br /><br />yeah, okay. i tire very much of f/f books inserting genuine power imbalances into their romances and pretending because it's gay, that erases it. it does not.<br /><br />my other issues that do not belong in the realm of ymmv:<br /><br />the author has stated outside the book that she conceived of both harrow and gideon as mixed maori. she specifically describes gideon as being dark-skinned. she never describes harrow's skintone at all in her blog post, but she does describe harrow as \"pale\" at one point in the book. so, to be clear: she made the dark-skinned brown woman an indentured servant to the light-skinned woman. this is only further reason why i did not care for their romance.<br /><br />there are also criticisms to be made regarding gideon's personality and the fact the author carelessly made her a brown woman, like the fact that a significant chunk of her personality is just All Brawns, No Brain. but, whatever. there are people better equipped than me to touch that topic. <br /><br />[editing much later to add: there's also now the issue the author is not a lesbian herself and the stereotypical traits she assigned to gideon as a butch lesbian.]<br /><br />beyond that, within the text itself: outside harrow being described as \"pale\" once, i cannot remember a single time their skintones are brought up. but i can remember plenty of times the explicitly white characters were. like: why even make it known you intended your two main protagonists to be mixed maori - especially when you're a white kiwi - and then never bring it up, at all? it feels like she just checked a box: \"my book is diverse!\" and put no thought into what that actually meant.<br /><br />6) okay, let's move on and return to ymmv territory. this one is more petty. i found the ianthe reveal incredibly obnoxious. i found ianthe in general obnoxious. coronabeth i was neutral toward. but, seriously: yes, i suspected something was up with ianthe. but it is also incredibly easy to have her go on about her brilliance and how \"none of you saw this coming!\" when she had, like, what? a grand total of ten lines in the entire book before then?<br /><br />7) in general: the fact that all the characters (sans camilla) i liked enough or that i found interesting ended up dying is another reason i cannot say i liked this book.<br /><br />8) the epilogue...what was that. i can't even say anything else. just, what was that. did you know i was actually leaning toward rating this book 4 stars anyway until i finished the epilogue? when my main interest in the book concerned the lore, i found the emperor's introduction...lacking.</label><br /><br />summary: i did not care for the two main protagonists nor their romance. i found a lot of the humor and prose insufferable. i found certain plot reveals equally insufferable, or otherwise disappointing. the end.<br /><br />in conclusion: did i like this book? no. was it interesting? yes."

The third book isn't coming out for another year and I need to pace myself or I may die from impatience. <br />The setting and magic system is very atmospheric, perfect for an October read. I've seen others complain that nothing was ever explained, but I like that about it! It adds to the chaos. Bones are flying everywhere. Gideon's wearing sunglasses and laughing in the face of death. There are skeletons waltzing around doing the washing up. It's perfect!!<br />Gideon always found a way to be witty/sarcastic, even in the direst situations. She is such a great character. The relationship between her and Harrow was so entertaining to watch develop. I'm so excited about the sequel, I just can't wait to see what happens between those two!!... If anything.... can?? Can it? I hope......I have no idea what will happen next.<br />Although this book doesn't have a romance, (well, anything more than undefined friendships that feel a little more than friends), it's very clear throughout the book that Gideon is a lesbian, and there are several other queer characters. I love subtle representation just as much as prominent romances, so I was very happy!<br />All in all, loved it! Loved the bones, loved the lesbians, and love the author for writing it."

      "review": "3/5 stars<br /> <br /><i>“If you do not find yourself a galaxy, it is not so bad to find yourself a star.”</i><br /><br />Well... I finished it.<br /><br />If I have nothing else to say, I can say that I finally finished the book I have tried a total of 6 times to read. I am going to try and find gentle and respectful words to explain my issues with this book as I do not want my legion of sapphic friends who adore this to pull an Ianthe and [redacted] me. I know you guys love this thing and I am not trying to shit on your interests, I promise. There are very fair critiques to be made of this, though. I think the major issue with this book boils down to 4 things: incorrect marketing, world-building issues, humor, and pacing. Let's take this one point at a time.<br /><br /><b>If you are easily upset by people disliking things that you like, protect your peace. Don't read this if it will upset you. I support what makes all of my friends happy and want y'all to know that!</b><br /><br /><br /><b>Incorrect Marketing:</b><br />This is marketed as a Sci-Fi/Fantasy (SF/F) book about lesbian/sapphic necromancers in space. This book reads like a mystery story. A group of teenagers, along with a few adults, travel to a planet for an assessment to become Lyctors—elite necromancers and advisers to the emperor. However, the house they stay in is haunted by mysterious creatures. As in a classic horror film, they are picked off one by one, turning the tale into a murder mystery. I am not saying that is a bad theme, just not what someone who picks up a Sci-Fi/Fantasy book is expecting. The mention of a spaceship doesn't make a story SF/F. There are particular beats and things that you hit when you write within a certain genre, and this just isn't SF/F. I personally don't like murder mystery plots, so that is what started losing me. I can see how other people who were expecting SF/F and got murder mystery were also confused and ended up giving up on it. <br /><br />We read this book for Queer book club because it is about <b>Lesbian Necromancers</b>. The \"lesbian\" is Gideon, who is not a necromancer and just has a crush(?) on a necromancer (who also has described many men as being hot so is definitely probably better described with the word \"Sapphic\" as opposed to \"Lesbian\" if you're asking me).<br /><br /><b>World-Building</b><br />The world-building of this universe is very intricate. Is it explained very well? Uh... I have bad news there. The reader is left in the dark, which is intentional I am sure. But when you are getting information about this world, it's way too confusing to understand. It's either nothing at all or 10+ pages of muddled information that is hard to put together. <br /><br />I had to watch 2 separate YouTube videos and spend 40 minutes of my time to understand the world that was being built in this book. As someone who regularly reads SF/F, I just cannot be forgiving of that. The argument that \"Gideon doesn't know a lot, so the reader doesn't know a lot\" is FAIR, but there is a way to write that so that its plot twist is revealed instead of being so confusing that it is incomprehensible. I should be able to follow a plot and world better than what is being given to me here. <br /><br />Thankfully, I have a solid understanding of Necromancy to a certain degree because of D&amp;D. But if you know nothing? This book isn't going to explain it to you. You are better off watching this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr8IcJ6QncQ\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"> YouTube video </a> to get it explained to you before you try reading this book. Which is wild that a book requires that at all...<br /><br /><b>Pacing/Humor (I am combining these into one part because they are short points and are entirely opinionated)</b><br />This story is divided into 5 acts. It takes 200-300 very very long pages to get to anything interesting plot-wise. It's just a very slow moving plot. That's not really what I like in a book. It made it feel like I had spent 5 weeks reading this book instead of 5 days. <br /><br />The humor in this is a bit dated and very dry. You can tell it is trying to be funny but either 1) you have the same sense of humor and this shit is hilarious to you or 2) you can tell it's trying to be funny, but you're just sitting there not laughing because it isn't funny to you. This purely will depend on what type of person you are and is in <b>no way a critique on how the author writes the humor</b>. I, unfortunately, didn't find it very funny. I am sure that this book is more enjoyable for those who find it to be hilarious. Again, some of the jokes are a bit dated now, but that's just the risk of putting humor into a book at all.<br /><br /><br />To conclude this essay...<br />I'm so sorry to TLT fans everywhere. Like seriously. I kept trying to make myself LOVE it, but I was just not into it. I have friends who cosplay this. Friends that helped FOUND THIS FANDOM. I just can't get into it like you guys have. I am sorry to Space Sapphic fans everywhere. Seriously. I am being so genuine that I am sorry. <br /><br />I am not ruling out the idea that I may pick up <i>Harrow the Ninth</i> or <i>Nona the Ninth</i> at some point in the future, I just am not doing it right now. Maybe distance will make my heart grow fonder regarding these books."

      "review": "Gideon the confused. That’s my summary. JK.<br /><br />Overall the book was to me a huge meh… The story lacked clear goals. I know Harrowhawk wanted to become a bigger servant than she already was for the necromancer emperor, but why? Her whole house was dead. It seemed like it was to hide the fact that <input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"spoiler__control\" aria-label=\"The following text has been marked spoiler. Toggle checkbox to reveal or hide.\" onchange=\"this.labels[0].setAttribute('aria-hidden', !this.checked);\" id=\"f15db6bf-f858-46d5-b2e2-99dab1148b35\" /><label aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"spoiler\" for=\"f15db6bf-f858-46d5-b2e2-99dab1148b35\">they’d killed 200 children to make 1 necromancer purebred baby, but the stakes confused me. Why would a necromancer, usually depicted as apathetic and death-happy be mad about people getting killed or sacrificed? Isn’t that their whole spiel? I don’t see how people who daily wield death can be abhorred by crimes such as murder. It doesn’t seem coherent.</label> A lot of things about Harrowhawk were too vague or contradicting. One moment she didn’t care if Gideon lived. The next she cried at the thought. In some scenes she’s depicted as a disgusting corpse. In others the author pulls out pretty lips. Is this girl a walking skeleton or thin babe? Or does Gideon find corpses sexy?<br /><br />As for Gideon’s sexuality. If she’s lesbian, so am I… Not to dump on her level of lesbian’ess, of course she’s queer and there’s no gate-keeping there, but if I was a lesbian, hoping for some representation or fun scenes, this book doesn’t deliver. Did she even kiss someone or hold hands with a cute girl? I don’t remember. I don’t think so. That’s a let down.<br /><br />Gideon, our MC, wanted to escape from Harrowhawk and blaze her own path, but quickly decided that <input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"spoiler__control\" aria-label=\"The following text has been marked spoiler.

Love that trope. I don’t get how they could bond when they had hated each other’s guts and had brutally bullied each other for years. At least one of them bullied the other. That kind of hatred doesn’t just go away. I don’t buy it.</label> The ending was cheesy and sappy. I expected heavier subjects and deeper trauma from a story surrounding death and the use of people’s bodies.<br /><br />As for the mystery… More is less. There was no need to make it so convoluted. Or read as convoluted. The reveals were too apparent or dull. The dullness was because I lacked the understanding as to why said reveal would come as shocking to the characters, due to poor build-up. The apparentness of the reveals stems from a lack of red-herrings.<br /><br />And, lastly. The world building. Girl… What were you even trying to do here? I loved the idea of paper being sparse or unused because necromancers lived a long time, longer than paper, and thus the technology would quickly become irrelevant, like CD’s the moment we got digital copies, but why do they lust for it like it’s twinkies in Zombieland? Paper should be a useless material. At least for long-keeping. And then there’s the tablets, comic books, electrical toothbrushes and spaceships in a place they prefer to use torches… HUh? Something’s not making sense here.<br /><br />Sidenote: The prose was varied and clever, but my ear still caught on words like ringlets, oily, chewed cheek or lips. Descriptions that can add flavor, but also rapidly turn tiring if misused. Still, good prose.<br /><br />Don’t read this book unless you like feeling superior to other human beings. I wouldn’t say it’s an acquired taste, but I know some would disagree. There!<br /><br />Oh yeah. I consumed it in audio form. Thanks, Moira."

I love the world building this author does for her universe. I find it helpful in epic fantasies when authors give a little narrative upfront about the main characters in the story and their interrelationships. The world is very grey where Gideon lives - even her porridge is grey. Her arrival in this house as a baby from a woman that fell into the world was very auspicious. Gideon attempted to run away when she was four, and tried 86 times to run away by the time she was 18. What were your initial impressions of this world?<br />I think its very bleak and its very much dystopia with the necromancers rising to take power?<br /><br />2. Harrow tricked Gideon when she talked about her offer of freedom. Gideon seemed to have the upper hand, but then Harrow won the fight through her earlier planning and planting that day. What do you think that says about their relationship?<br />I think Harrow likes Gideon mostly but doesn't respect her life very much.<br /><br />3. So Harrow wants Gideon to be her guardian as she travels to the other houses. Seems like a good opportunity to get off the Ninth, and become a Cohort. Gideon does take the position. Do you think that was a good choice for her?<br />Yes I think it will get her out of the house and may be into another life. Also could prove herself to Harrow.<br /><br />4. I liked when Gideon’s sword instructor said “anyone can learn to fight, not anyone can learn to think”. Do you think that Gideon needs to do more thinking than fighting?<br />Yes. I think she needs to be more conniving during a fight. Although she isn't bad at doing the thinking and fighting she just needs to think smarter.<br /><br />5. What do you think about the House of the First? The world seems like the exact opposite of the ninth in terms of light and sky, rather than everything grey. All the houses are there - do you think Gideon is going to get into trouble or save Harrow from trouble?<br />I'm curious about where all the people are and its going to be a dark reveal I think. Teacher isn't going to be as cheerful as he appears! Is it hatred or is it sort of love? Very difficult to get the gist of the feelings between them.</label><br /><b>Day Two</b> <input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"spoiler__control\" aria-label=\"The following text has been marked spoiler.

I think we all had a feeling (including Gideon) that Harrow wanted her ring - &amp; of course, she got it. What do you think was her purpose of stealing the ring from Gideon?<br />Harrow doesn't trust Gideon, anything Gideon has that Harrow thinks is useful she acts like its hers.<br /><br />7. Gideon has never seen modern technologies such as a sink with running water, or a toilet. She didn’t even know the difference between night &amp; day... nor had she ever had a hot beverage before. This, in itself, tells us more about the Ninth than we knew before, but could also leave room for speculation. Would you consider this book to be speculative fiction? If so, what are some of the different things you could speculate from this or other parts of the story?<br />I'm not sure what Speculative Fiction is. I think it just merely shows something that has been hinted at; that the ninth house is the dark house and the poorest one. Its pretty much the lowest in ranking even though they pretend otherwise. Reading between the lines the higher the number the lower power or ranking.<br /><br />8. Somehow the Third twin knew Gideon was hiding in the stairwell eavesdropping, even though she couldn’t physically see her, &amp; told her that isn’t the way to start things off. Will this encounter affect Gideon &amp; the Twins in the future? Is it a sign of what’s to come?<br />I think this is a sign that the third house is stronger.<br /><br />9. What do you think Dulcinea’s motive is when talking to Gideon? She seems to be the only one really “intrigued” by Gideon, to the point of wanting to be around her a lot. Is this just normal, friendly interest? Or is there something bigger at play here?<br />I think she is going to be one of the big twists. I also think this is the author's attempt at a love interest. </label><br /><b>Day Three</b> <input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"spoiler__control\" aria-label=\"The following text has been marked spoiler.

Thoughts on the deaths, did you care to lose these two or are you just waiting for the body count to increase?<br />Both, I thought they were interesting characters.<br /><br />11. I like the electric toothbrush detail. What do you think of the room they found? Are there any details from the room that you think are going to be important later?<br />I thought that was funny, and interesting. I don't really get the world the author's built though. These points make me think its Dystopia but then again it doesn't.<br /><br />12. The letter clearly has Gideon’s name in it (see below) but we get no comment from Gideon as the narrator on her reaction to this. What do you think of this as an author’s choice and what do you think the letter means?<br />\" ut we all know the sad + trying realit<br />is that this will remain incomplete t<br />the last. He can’t fix my deficiencies her<br />ease give Gideon my congratulations, howev\"<br />No idea, I don't even remember this note.<br /><br />13. This quote feel like somewhat heavy handed foreshadowing , though I may be wrong.<br />“You’re all right. Gideon, Gideon … you’re so young. Don’t give yourself away. Do you know, it’s not worth it … none of this is worth it, at all. It’s cruel. It’s so cruel. You are so young—and vital—and alive. Gideon, you’re all right … remember this, and don’t let anyone do it to you ever again. I’m sorry. We take so much. I’m so sorry.”<br />She would remember each word later, loud and clear. It seems to imply this is Dulcinea’s voice and does this impact your opinion of her?<br />Yeah. I was more suspicious of her than ever. Shes too 'nice' I just don't trust the nice.<br /><br />Bonus Question: The skulls on top of the chapters belong to each house but I have been unable to find any pattern or meaning to their order. Anyone think there is a purpose or pattern? Did I miss something obvious?<br />I can't answer this! :-( </label><br /><b>Day Four</b> <input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"spoiler__control\" aria-label=\"The following text has been marked spoiler.

More deaths! Do you have any theories on why the Fourth were killed? Why Gideon was spared? Who do you think is committing these murders?<br />Its to stop them from reaching what ever the goal is. Its going to be another contestant.<br /><br />15. The Third House (maybe Ianthe) seem to be lurking in the background of this book, all sneaky and suspicious. Coronabeth seems like the nicer one out of the Twins. But do you think this is the case? Do you think Coronabeth has something up her sleeves?<br />I think she is the nicer one, and Ianthe is like Harrow.<br /><br />16. Gideon had a weird encounter with the Eighth house. What did you make of the comment, 'because you grew up servant to a murderer, in a tribe of murderers. You are, more than anything, a victim of the Ninth House'. Do you think Gideon will accept their invitation?<br />Nope, she is too suspicious of everyone, I think its sometimes better the devil you know.<br /><br />17. (This is a bit of a silly question). Over the course of the book, Gideon has been getting closer to Harrow, Dulcinea and Coronabeth (although it seems she wishes she could get closer to the latter). Put yourself in Gideon's shoes. Harrow, Dulcinea and Coronabeth - Kiss, Marry, Kill.. Explain your reasoning haha!<br />Kill Dulcinea - shes 'dying' anyway. Kiss Coronabeth - shes pretty but a different house so wouldn't be possible or accepted, Marry Harrow - I don't think she would let you leave anyway. </label><br /><b>Day Five</b> <input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"spoiler__control\" aria-label=\"The following text has been marked spoiler.

We get a lot of thanalogical (??) science theory chat in the section, with the exchanges between Palamedes and Harrow, which seems to confuse them at least as much as it did me! Did you enjoy the science chat and reveals, or did it get in the way of the action?<br />I found the way the author experimented with the necromancer fantasy world and pulled the way necromancy works in normal fantasy novels. I did appreciate the differences and the way its like there is nothing else that exists and modern medicine is almost scorned. Its an interesting take when you think we do the opposite in the society we have.<br /><br />19. We see other sides to a couple of the Houses during this section: the Eighth, who had been reported as being super weird with the cavalier being effectively a vegetable, actually transpire to be super weird with the cavalier trying really hard to hold to whatever shred of his life he can claim as his own (Colum says: \"I've got my sword. I've got my honour. Everything else is yours.\" \"Your sword is mine also\" said Silas. Silas is an ass of the highest order, btw)<br />Similarly, the Second become all noble and self-sacrificing in chapter 33, a change from the rule-bound nimrods they'd been up to that point.<br />Do you like the shifting understanding of the characters? Have your favourites / least despised changed over the course of the book?<br />I don't really care for many of the other houses. They all have their own ideals of how they should act and how they should let everyone else act.<br /><br />20. Speaking of changes: MASSIVE emotional reveal between Harrow &amp; Gideon. I loved the line \"she wrapped her arms around Harrow Nonagesimus and held her long and hard, like a scream\", which is just SO Ninth House. How does this information make you re-evaluate Harrow &amp; Gideon's relationship?<br />I always figured that this was going to be the love interest. It was so convenient, almost comforting for the author to do this. Gideon always did what Harrow wanted even when Gideon said no she would do as she said.<br /><br />21. Something a bit lighter: in the midst of the blood and death and bone-key making and such, there are still some moments that made me snigger. one that I particularly enjoyed was \"Hm,\" said Camilla neutrally, and Gideon knew immediately that she organised Palamedes's and her socks by colour and genre.\"<br />The little blips of humour have definitely helped me whilst reading the book. Do they work for you?<br />For me the humour didn't come across in audio. Maybe because its the audio but more because it just wasn't really that amusing to me. I guess I was fed up during the style of humour so I didn't take much notice of the humour</label><br /><b>Day Six</b><input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"spoiler__control\" aria-label=\"The following text has been marked spoiler.

In chapter 3 we get the first of the big reveals. Were you surprised by the actual dynamic between the twins? And were you as creeped out as I was by Ianthe's little speech about the place between life and death...\"where the things are that eat us.\"?<br />No not really surprised. I thought it was pretty understandable, no one believed they were both necromancers to begin with anyway.<br /><br />23. There have been many types of necromancy and magic and science talked about and demonstrated in this story. In sci-fi and fantasy books, I often find myself wishing that some of the science or magic was real. Are there any aspects of this world that you wish was real, or that intrigues you?<br />Not really, this magic and world feels very bleak and I don't want that in my life!!<br /><br />24. The second big reveal gave us the name of the big bad. I personally did not find clues to this littered throughout the story, so I was surprised. Did you find this reveal satisfying? Surprising? Did you enjoy the fight at the end?<br />Nope. This sounds big headed but I figured this out very quickly. I've put in before I didn't trust her so I think I can say that and be fair. Not very satisfying but interesting to be right, I thought the fight scene was probably the best part of this book and saved it personally from moving to a 2 star and to stay at a 3.<br /><br />25. Was anyone else waiting for a sex scene? Why use the term \"lesbian necromancers\" in the description? Who cares if they are heterosexual or gay if it really doesn't come into the story? Marketing? Or do you think it was an important story point that the main character liked girls?<br />I wrote out a massive rant about this and then decided I was being too harsh and deleted it but; this annoyed me most about the book. If it says lesbian necromancers could I get lesbian necromancers. Its hinted too thinly, I wanted more. Not sex scenes but romance or an acknowledgement of 'feelings' between them. Its just too veiled.<br /><br />26. Will Gideon's and Camilla's bodies or selves be recovered? Will you read the next book to find out? Did you like the book?<br />I won't read the next book although I am curious but I don't think I can put myself through this world again. However, I don't believe Gideon is actually dead. It was said that they couldn't kill her as a baby so I'm curious to know how she managed it. I didn't like this book but I don't hate it, I've got huge problems with this book and I liked some aspects of it too. Not a simple yes or no.</label><br /><b>Final thoughts</b><br />I CALLED IT. I KNEW IT.<br />Anyway, I just didn't love this. It was so so, this is too dystopia and I can't say I love dystopia. <br />Also LGBT? Where? Its hinted very lightly that she is in love with Harrow and Harrow wants her but lets be honest a hint is just a hint. I kept expecting a BIG thing but nope. I suppose the only thing is the end. I can't write anything else without spoiling it but if you like Dystopian fantasy this isn't a bad read for you. Its a bit odd and the amount of characters with less than common names you'll probably get a bit confused. In the group someone suggested having a sample open with character names to keep you straight but honestly that sounds silly to me, I don't normally have to do that so I shouldn't have to do that while listening to audio.<br /><b>Would I read again?:</b> Nope<br /><b>Would I read this author again?:</b> Maybe"

      "review": "I gotta stop getting hype for popular books. I think I might have rated this book higher - and enjoyed it more - if I hadn't had sky high expectations going in<br /><br />The good:<br />*The representation. One thing that continually frustrates me in speculative fiction is this assumption that our societal biases will always exist. Even in stories with women and queer folks, it's nearly always in the context of sexism and homophobia. Like we can conceive a world with dragons but not without discrimination. Most of the characters in this book were women - including the fighters, and at least Gideon is queer - harder to say for others since it's Gideon only POV and not a lot of romance on-screen. But they were characters who were queer and women, not Women Characters and Queer Characters. There was not a SINGLE mention of it being weird that women were fighting, women being weak, etc. Not one. And it was so damn refreshing<br /><br />*Originality. I read a lot of spec fic, and tbh a lot of it blends together. The same characters, the same plot structure, the same general setting. This was not that. Doesn't cleanly fit into one genre. Everything felt new and original and not like something I've read before, which was really great. No farm boys on a quest to defeat the Dark One over here<br /><br />*The main plot. I really enjoyed the murder mystery style of most of the book, and was 100% along for the ride when things started getting revealed and went off the rails<br /><br />The bad:<br />*There was a major relationship change that could have been really good, but did not have the groundwork to get there, so it felt like an extremely sudden 180, and minimized any feels I had for the climax. Not an \"instalove\" situation, but the same lack of investment as those relationships<br /><br />*I just could not connect very well with the characters. Most of the side characters were 1 dimensional - the only ones that really stuck out were the 6th house, and even Harrow and Gideon were a little flat, though not to the same extent<br /><br />*Smells like YA. Look, I have NOTHING against YA. It's not a bad genre or anything. When I expect YA. This was not marketed as YA, and while some plot elements were more adult spec fic, some hit tried and true and frankly recycled YA plot beats. It also felt like 2010 when each House had a Designated Personality Trait, and they all started killing each other. I notice this often happens in debut novels.<br /><br /><br />A bit of both:<br />*The humor. I really enjoyed Gideon's deadpan narrating, injection of humor at inopportune times, bad puns. Yeah it was a little forced, but I was here for it. Unfortunately that was dampened by her use of modern day slang for some of the humor, which really pulled me out of the story<br /><br />*The world building and pacing. In reading reviews, it looks like a lot of people had issues with the slow build of the plot and the confusion. This didn't bother me at all - my genre of choice is high fantasy, where we start a plot at the end of the first 800 page novel and maybe start understanding the world about the same spot. But it could definitely be off putting. And I'm willing to put up with that because I get invested in the characters...which I wasn't here. I was a bit confused by all the characters, but that was more on me. I did this on audiobook, mostly at work, where I listened with half an ear. This....was not a good book for that. The magic system was cool, but could have been better defined. <br /><br />Overall, this was a great concept that was kinda well executed. Didn't blow my socks off. But, it's the first in a series AND a debut novel. I like the general vibes enough to give the sequel a try. Hoping the author will grow out of those issues commonly seen in a debut - pacing, recycled plot points, etc, and 18 or so more hours will allow the characters to grow on me and the world and magic system to get more defined."

      "review": "Rereading super hyped books I didn't click with at all now that the hype train is over!<br /><br />This is one of two books I've gotten hate mail for not liking. Incredible, really. All the awesome cosplays and booktok raving over it made me give it another go. It also seemed like a good way to kick off my spooky season reading list.<br /><br />The “lesbian necromancers- in space!” tagline printed across the book still just doesn’t live up to everything it promises. Seeing how it’s Gideon- who has a crush on a woman, and that’s about all the queer rep. I question this especially since Gideon thought a male character was also especially scrumptious, she oggled him just as much as the women. It’s okay for characters to be bi?! Also- there are necromancers, sure, but their magic is more like a tool that isn't super magical, they aren’t really out here doing cool necromancer stuff. The necromancers are more like annoying prison guards and they do bone magic. I was hoping for more hanging out with the dead, but they mostly just dealt with bone constructs. <br /><br />And sure, they are in space, but we don’t get to know how the planet system works and much about the environments at all. They go on a space shuttle ride, the shuttles are mentioned 3 or 4 times, and that is how you know it’s sci-fi I guess, because nothing else is science about this fiction. It’s a bit odd when you’re in the catacombs on some barren planet apparently and then suddenly there are playboy magazines, rocket ships, and space stations, and it isn’t ever explained. How the heck did she get those magazines on a barren, medieval, death planet where *real paper* is a huge deal? We just have to accept it. I think the author had half a thought of writing a space opera but then forgot. It is as much *in space* as we on Earth are technically *in space*.<br /><br />Right off the bat we are shoved into jargon upon unexplained jargon, so many terms that eventually start to make sense just from seeing them so many times but it is a lot to be thrown into. I feel like I’m set up for failure when I find (so far) the main antagonist the most interesting character. Harrowhark- necromancer, the Reverend Daughter, dead parents, (but shhh) softly snarky but doesn’t try too hard. I also took Harrow’s hands being described as bony a little too seriously, I think? I have 100% thought that Harrow was a reanimated skeleton until reread, approx 30% in, when I happened upon the book 2 cover art and notice that she is drawn as a fleshy person. That changes a lot of things. In full honesty I was picturing Harrowhark like an Abyss Mage from Genshin Impact until this moment. I was actually so convinced that people were so starved for lesbian (or bi, ok) fiction that they settled for the literal animated skeleton, and the edgelord with a sword. This has never happened before. <br /><br />The worldbuilding is still strangely thin to me, despite the author describing things for like 10 pages on end sometimes. I don’t know how she manages to so well describe all this environment without ever making me feel like the world is being built as a solid whole. Like, there’s bones, there’s blood and stuff, fighting, more bones. Some tombs and stuff. Space travel technology? The writing is mostly style and lacks the substance I wish it would hold. <br /><br />I must say, much like I assumed for Harrowhark, these characters have no meat to them. There are so many characters with all of the different houses and their “necromancers” and cavaliers during the competition, and I can’t find it in myself to enjoy them or care much about what they are doing in the story. They have nothing to them, nothing to set them apart from each other, so there’s just this crowd of people. It doesn’t even seem to matter to the story if I don’t know exactly which of the random people are arguing with Gideon at any given time. <br /><br />Gideon herself is an issue, she has this tragic backstory going for her and she seems like an interesting enough story vessel, but she’s just so Edgy Teenager TM. She perpetually speaks like an angry 15 year old whose parents are going through a messy divorce, and this isn’t restricted to just the dialogue, it is also in the rest of the exposition throughout the book. She has clearly had a hard life, but yeesh. I’m told this isn’t even supposed to be YA, but the obnoxious childish attitude from Gideon makes her the poster child of insufferable YA protags. Her whole edgelord tone, how everything has to be sarcastic or antagonistic or accusatory, she’s just miserable as a character. She doesn’t seem to be using this hard exterior for any purpose- such as to protect herself or because of insecurities, and this is because Gideon has approximately 0 introspection. How does she feel about any given awful event in her life? Who knows, she’s probably screaming childish insults at someone about it though. <br /><br />What also makes it feel very YA is the manufactured competition plot device. In the beginning it seemed like there could be so many possibilities on how this story could go and I was pretty excited for them to explore this world and maybe figure out how everything fits together. But then they’re just locked in this competition thing for the whole book and it flushed all the creativity of this worldbuilding down the drain. When people start mysteriously dying, it wasn’t even gripping. The author didn’t manage to make me care about any of the killed off characters. The competition and the murder mystery lacked tension, they lacked stakes. I could predict how everyone was getting killed off, so the author did a good job at sprinkling in enough information to put that together.<br /><br />The relationship is inherently toxic. Harrow and Gideon have such a drastic power imbalance that them being together does not seem healthy in any capacity. Not to mention how Harrow ranged from antagonizing to full on abusing Gideon for her whole life. They despise each other so much at the start of this book, and the power imbalance is VERY clear, Gideon being an indentured servant and Harrow being what, the top of the power structure for this planet? I think this was an attempt at enemies to lovers except that tension isn’t built, so it ends up just being a bully romance. But it lacks the chemistry that a good bully romance should have so it fell short of what it could have been. <br /><br />I will say that this author is pretty good at writing a compelling fight scene. I usually am bored by the average fight scene, but the fights were my favorite parts of this book. They were where Gideon felt like an engaging character to read about. <br /><br />It’s really disappointing when a book, on paper, in the blurb, seems like every single thing that I would love and then it fails to hit on all the marks that would make me like it. I tried so hard to enjoy it, came at it with an open mind, then would just find myself annoyed. I actually think that if the author slowed down a bit and gave the story more time to unfold I would have enjoyed it more, there isn't very much downtime between action. But saying all of that, I am plenty curious about that ending, I’m curious if Gideon’s parents and where she came from will ever be explained. I also would love to know more about what exactly that is in the locked tomb. Rereading did actually make me want to read more of this series, and maybe it will be from a different character’s POV with any luck. "

I am unsure at what has me stumped but I feel... confounded. <br />Perhaps its the fact that since this book was released in 2019, it was lauded and awarded with praise and placed on many pedestals and best books lists. <br /><br />Perhaps it's because when this book is pitched by book reviewers, they all recite similar things, with similar layers of excitement and love. <br /><i>What I thought I knew was three things; <br />- This was lesbian<br />- This was a locked room mystery<br />- This was necromancers in space</i><br /><br />These things may be true in an abstract way, but <u>they are not necessarily true. </u><br /><br />1. <b>This was gay (particularly of the lesbian vareity) </b><br />I am truely baffled that this at reviews I see of this book. One states <i> the girl gets the girl at the end.</i>... huh???? What???? did we read the same book? No one gets anyone at the end. There is barely a glimpse of a romance in this book. Sure there are flimsy crushes, and most are between women, but that does not mean this is a book were <i> the girl gets the girl at the end.</i> The plot focuses on other things so far beyond romance that I felt mislead into believing that there was a big heaping lesbian love story in the middle of this. All I left was the ashes of two people who hated each other and kind of respected each other at the end (I get into that later, but tldr: I hated that they became amicable at the end, and came to an understanding, and forgiveness because, and I say this with no peace, and only pure unindulterd hatred, fuck Harrowhark Nonagesimus, Reverend Daughter of the Ninth House, and may she die via being punted into the sun). <br /><br /><b>Lesbians existing - yes.<br />Lesbian love story - myth.</b><br /><br />2. <b>This was locked room mystery </b><br />Locked room mysteries have evolved with time, no longer simply people being stuck in a small room, that is locked. The trope has expanded and stretched to its limited, some including the isolation setting, some like this book including that it is an entire building. <br />Perhaps I misunderstood what others meant, but I what was definitely re-iterated was that they were all stuck in a the same place, and they all had to figure a mystery out, and also people were dropping like flies while they were doing that.<br /><br /><b>Competition - yes<br />Puzzles - yes </b>(however, they are not for us, the reader, to understand or figure out, as the puzzles are of necromancy science)<br /><b>Locked room mystery - not really, </b> sure they are locked in but solving the puzzles wont get you out, nor solve the murders. I do think it is <a href=\"https://goodreads.com/book/show/6251563.And_Then_There_Were_None\" title=\"And Then There Were None by Agatha Christie\" rel=\"noopener\">And Then There Were None</a> type scenario and people are solving puzzles.<br /><br />2. <b>This was necromancers in space </b><br />Sure. <br />Well... the necromancers were there yes. Gideon isn't one so those reviews saying <i>lesbian necromancers in space are factually incorrect. </i> Gideon is queer, in space and swings a sword but is very much not a necromancer.<br />My main bone to pick on this one is the space aspect. This book is barely in space. Everything leans so heavily within the fantasy realm that I forgot multiple times that this was also meant to be partly sci-fi. I like when fantasy and science fiction merge and are explored but this felt less a merge, and more an entirely of a fantasy book with sci-fi bits stuck on in post. <br /><br /><b>In space - technically, sure.<br />Necromancers - some yes, but Gideon is not one.</b><br /><br /><br /><br /><b>However, what I find was the most grievous offence was Harrowhark and the shackles she had chained and abused Gideon with. </b><br />Harrowhark is not a <i>good</i> person. <br />Okay, fine. So what?<br />Well, this book acts like despite Harrowhark's actions, Gideon should (and does) forgive her, and forge some unshakeable bond with, via friendship or some hinted at romance, I don't really know or really care. What I find inexplicable is that other reviewers see this abuse, this dysfunctional relationship, call it <i>messy</i> and <i>imperfect</i> and yet still simper and yearn. HUH???? <br /><br />When buidling up such a toxic relationship, an enemies-to(-maybe)-lovers arc, a redemption arc is thrown in there. The hard and taxing work is making this redemption arc, this evolution of character believable. It has to be painful, it has to be vulnerable and it has to be convincing. <b>Harrowhark's evolution never felt very painful, was only slightly vulnerable, and at no point was I convinced. </b><br /><br />Gideon was childish but loveable. She was honourable, she was brave and she was weighed down but the abuse, and lack of love, support and nurturing someone should get. She was a seventeen year old who was continually hammered by life, and still felt hope, still felt joy in cracking puns and swinging her big longsword. Her aspirations was simply to live an actual full life outside her indentured servitude, to see planets, to make friends and fight in wars. She wanted more, and she deserved more. <br /><br />Harrowhark and her family held Gideon's life in their hands, they owned her, they stole her childhood, any form of joy and happiness and at the beginning you see them once again steal two more things from Gideon that nearly made me DNF. They stole her escape out of this abusive house, and they stole her future outside of it. <br /><br />Yes, there are interesting themes of duty and loyalty, the extremes of life and death, and what it means when you try to stretch all of themes to their breaking point. There are themes of destiny, of responsibility, guilt, honour, godhood and purpose bigger than oneself. Gideon grappled with all these themes and so did Harrowhark. <br />Unfortunately, all these big, grand themes pale in my dislike of Gideon's situation, Harrowhark's role in it and their unearned reconciliation. <br /><br /><b>I am shocked at the ending. I am angry about the \"resolution\" between Harrowhark and Gideon. I feel lied too, cheated and now just plain angry. Fuck Harrowhark and fuck this book. </b><br /><br /><br /><b>Other dislikes</b><br />- Questionable world-building<br />- Action scenes were kind of boring, too scientific and lacked clarity<br />- Too many people and too many houses, too many heirs and their cavaliers.<br />- Book was somehow too long but not enough details<br /><br /><br />I will say the audiobook was great. If I didn't have that, I would have DNF'ed way earlier.<br /><br /><br /><i>Would I recommend this book??</i> <br />No.<br /><br /><i>Will I re-read this book? </i><br />No.<br /><br /><pre><a href=\"https://decodethebooks.wordpress.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Blog</a> ✿ <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/decodethebooks\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Goodreads</a> ✿ <a href=\"https://twitter.com/decodethebooks/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Twitter</a> ✿ <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/decodethebooks/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Instagram</a> ✿ <a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/decodethebooks/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Pinterest</a> ✿ <a href=\"https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/decodethebooks\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">StoryGraph</a> ✿ <a href=\"https://reedsy.com/discovery/user/decodethebooks\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Discovery</a> ✿ </pre>"

      "review": "<b>4 STARS<br /><br />“One flesh, one end.”</b><br /><br />Gideon Nav means to get out from under the thumb of the Ninth, and make her own way in the universe. She definitely does not mean to become the cavalier of necromancer Harrowhark Nonagesimus, Reverend Daughter of the Ninth. But, as things tend to go, one thing leads to another, and these two, who despise one another, must work together anyway, or die trying.<br /><br />It’s a dynamic I absolutely love, to tell the truth, and it makes for a story that relies on your connection to the characters to keep your interest. Are Gideon and Harrow necessarily people you’d want to root for? Oh, definitely not. They’re crass and sharp and in it for self-interested reasons. But as characters, they’re outstanding on their own and in a group dynamic, complicating expectations and complicating each other.<br /><br />Plus, they’re such polar opposites that it’s <i>fun</i> to watch them learn to rely on each other. They’re so long-suffering and it’s a <i>delight</i>.<br /><br /><b>Gideon the Ninth is a bit of a genre-blender.</b><br /><br />In addition to the excellent characterization (it takes some hard work to make me root for people who are arguably complete jerks!), <i>Gideon the Ninth</i> does some ambitious work with genre blending. What initially feels like sci-fi, set in deep space with shuttles between planets and hints of a broader universe, takes on the flavor of fantasy the second Harrow first raises a slew of skeletons from the ground beneath her. Then, just when you’re comfortable with the notion of necromancers in space, the advanced tech is shifted to a different arena, and a mystery slides to the forefront, complete with murder and betrayal. It makes it terribly difficult to slot the novel into just one category, and makes the approach to the plot even more interesting. I am a <b>sucker</b> for mysteries, and blending it with this sci-fi/fantasy approach is a win in my heart.<br /><br />That said, all this genre blending does mean that character takes the forefront, and plot falls to the back seat. That’s not to say there’s a lack of plot, but that it’s on the slow side. In fact, I docked a star in my rating for this, because with all the questions established, so very few felt like they were answered, and the clues piled up faster than answers rolled in.<br /><br />It’s effective in making me want to read the second book in the trilogy, <i>Harrow the Ninth</i> (which, incidentally, is told in second person, one hell of a feat), and it keeps me guessing since I enjoy trying to solve mysteries with whatever limited information the author has given me so far. Nevertheless, the ending and its lack of answers did frustrate me a little bit, and I wish a few more things had been included in the reveals, just to close a few more doors, or open new ones to ponder over.<br /><br /><b>Now, if you’re looking for an f/f romance, this is not the place.</b><br /><br />Sure, the blurb on the front cover advertises the book as lesbian necromancers in space. It’s not <i>wholly</i> wrong, either. No labels are used in the text, but it’s pretty clear that Gideon has an interest in women. And her relationship with Harrowhark? It’s some of the sharpest enemies to almost lovers I’ve read, full of snark and complicated history.<br /><br />But it’s not a romance. This is not about two ladies falling in love. It’s about solving murders using brute strength and the undead. It’s about reconciling who we thought we’re supposed to be with who we’ve become. And while I have no doubts that Gideon’s relationship with Harrowhark is on the enemies to lovers track (that pool scene alone? raise your hand if you know what I’m talking about, because <i>wow)</i>, they don’t kiss, and they don’t say they’re in love.<br /><br />Then again, I think if your characters have to kiss and say “I love you” to prove to the reader they’re in love, they’re probably not in love. At least not on a convincing, satisfying level, which means this? This was outstanding.<br /><br />Truthfully, I’m reminded a little of Catra and Adora from She-Ra and the Princesses of Power. They manage to hate each other and care about each other at the same time, and the tension is unreal. Would direct rep be nice? Sure would, but in this book? It’s an adult novel, and I think its intended audience should be able to connect the dots without spelling everything out in blinking lights.<br /><br /><b>I can’t wait to see the fallout in <i>Harrow the Ninth.</i></b><br /><br /><i>Gideon the Ninth</i> is a fantastic example of what you can do with genre blending. Not only that, but it presents wonderfully flawed, complex characters trapped in situations they can’t walk away from. Maybe the plot moves a little slowly, maybe not enough reaches a complete conclusion this time around, but damn if I couldn’t look away all the same.<br /><br />I’ll be waiting eagerly for <i>Harrow the Ninth</i>. With the promise of an entire chunk of the book in second person, the writer in me wants to sink their teeth into the technical elements of the novel. And with the promise of Harrow’s POV working out the events of <i>Gideon the Ninth</i>, the reader in me desperately wants to see how these plot threads move along and resolve.<br /><br />If you can stand a slightly slower plot that boosts its characters up, <i>Gideon the Ninth</i> may be worth a try for you. And if you like exciting fight scenes and necromancy, this may also be a sign you should give it a try. I went in skeptical because of polarized reviews, admittedly. People seem to either love it or hate it.<br /><br />But I’m here until the next book. I’m here to find out exactly how deep into space these necromancers are going to go.<br /><br />And if they have more conversations about their feelings, <i>dammit.<br /><br /> <br />CW: violence, gore, suicide, loss of a loved one, child death, child abuse, body horror<br /><br />I cannot understate the amount of bones, blood, and guts flying around this book. The final fight scene is particularly gory, featuring a good deal of body horror adjacent content. It goes hand in hand with necromancy, but some folks would understandably not want to touch that. Keep that in mind before you read, if gore is a sticking point for you.</i>"

      "review": "There was a mix of good and bad with this book, so I'll break it down.<br /><br />Neutral (things worth mentioning, but aren't necessarily good or bad):<br />-This story definitely puts the focus on the characters over the world-building/lore, action, or overall story.<br /><br />What I liked:<br />-The overall premise of the story (galaxy-wide space necromancy) was super interesting and has huge potential to be interesting and unique. The galaxy being split into nine different houses, each with a different focus/ability related to necromancy, allows for some variation within the world and magic system. There is a lot of open space (pun heavily intended) to add lore and a really deep level of history to the universe.<br />-The characters (particularly Gideon and Harrow) are well-written, in my opinion, and their character arcs were satisfying and mostly believable.<br />-The combat was satisfyingly detailed and incorporated both the necromancy magic and swordplay very well (with one exception that I'll mention later).<br />-While visible from miles away, both aspects of the ending were satisfying and have me ready for the next book.<br />-The lesbian aspect of the book wasn't the focal point of the book/story. I was afraid that the LGBT aspect would be the focus and the rest of the book would be ignored. Instead, it's never outright stated that the MC(s) are lesbian and is just heavily implied through descriptions of how the characters see other females. By doing this, it successfully had an LGBT element without seeming like it was screaming, \"LOOK, I HAVE A LESBIAN CHARACTER! I'M WOKE TOO! EVERYONE LOOK, A LESBIAN CHARACTER!\" which was nice. To be clear, I have no issues with LGBT characters in books, but outside of romance, it's boring to have sexuality overshadow the story.<br /><br />What I didn't like:<br />-The prose of the book was really weird at times. There were some spots that I'm 90% sure were grammatically incorrect (and these sections weren't dialogue), but I never bothered to check. There were also several other spots where, while grammatically correct, the sentenced seemed to be designed to make it as difficult as possible to read and understand. There were also a lot of parentheses, which I hate in books because it pulls me out of the story.<br />-Parts of the book were really slow and didn't advance the story at all. There was a large chunk of the book where Gideon just aimlessly roamed the halls of the house that everyone was in while Harrow was off doing undescribed investigations. It almost felt as if the author wasn't sure how to start the main part of the story and make the characters discover that the house they were in was basically a giant puzzle. So, instead, we got pages and pages of Gideon doing pushups and roaming the hallways until suddenly Harrow shows up and says ~\"I've discovered a puzzle in the house and it requires necromancy to solve.\"<br />-The overall world-building was lackluster and didn't really feel like a sci-fi fantasy; it felt almost purely like a fantasy. Outside of the brushed over idea of space and the meagerly mention space-shuttles there were almost not sci-fi elements. I said that he story focused mainly on the characters, so it would be expected that the world might not be as flushed out as a story whose focus was on the that world, but we really needed a lot more. Basically, we are told that the universe almost died (or humanity was almost extinct) and the Undying Emperor saved it and brought everyone back. We are never told what this thing was, but I suspect it'll have a large part in the sequels. The whole Gideon-wandering-halls-while-Harrow-investigates-the-house thing would've been a great opportunity to add to the world-building.<br />-Also, (and this ties in with the world-building problem) the magic was presented poorly. Like I said, the magic was cool and described well, when in action, but it was explained poorly. Basically, we weren't told anything about the magic until that aspect of the magic system became relevant in the book. This created two problems. 1: Every time a new method of necromancy was used (and thus, its existence just now mentioned us) it felt to me more \"plot convenience\" than intricate and complicated magic system. 2: A lot and I mean A LOT of the time a new aspect of the necromancy was introduced to us, it was also at the same time that we were being told that very rule of necromancy isn't actual a rule and can be broken. I never felt any wonder at the magic because I was never told that this is the magic and this is how it works before I was told it actually doesn't work like that. It was more of a \"They did this thing\" and I'd be like \"Yeah, so?\" and then the story would be like \"That's impossible, you shouldn't be able to do that.\" See the problem? There was no interest or significance to the fact that a \"rule\" of the necromancy was being broken.<br />-There are a couple of logistical issues in the story that I'm going to mention in this last point.<br /> 1-Everyone uses swords. Why? They have space-shuttles, but they use swords? At one point the main character even finds some old guns, so we know they exist, but why don't they use them? I'm all for swords, I love swords, but there needs to be an in-universe explanation for their use when more advanced and more effective weapons exist.<br /> 2-Cavaliers (bodyguards for necromancers) traditionally carry rapiers. Since they're guarding necromancers, one would think they might being fighting other necromancers and I can't think of any sword worse for fighting reanimated skeletons that can only be killed by smashing them more than a rapier. The book even addresses the fact that a longsword (and in another case, duel broader-bladed, curved swords) are better for killing them, but it never states why they still choose the rapier over weapons that are obviously far more effective.<br /><br />TL;DR<br />Gideon The Ninth had some issues, but nothing so bad that I couldn't read it or enjoy it. If you can turn your brain off to some of the logistical issues, then I'd by all means recommend it. It's certainly an enjoyable read. Hopefully, some of the logistical concerns will be addressed in the second book since I plan on reading the sequel when it comes out. I'm really excited to see where the story goes in a universe with so much potential."

      "review": "3.5/5. Gideon the Ninth, more like Gideon my wife!<br /><br />*****Anyone who told you this is lesbian necromancers in space as a pitch is lying and sensationalized the book to be something it's not. This also isn't a romance, which the promotion would have you believe. There are queer women, at least two, but nothing is confirmed on page and at no point do the two main characters say that they're lesbians. Just a disclaimer because I know people are coming to this for lesbian romance and that's NOT what this is. The most queer thing that happens is Gideon reads girlie magazines and is attracted to women, but there's not real flirting, kissing, etc. None of that is the author's fault I just wanted to put that out there. *****<br /><br />The plot is basically about nine planets who all are subject to the same king. He brings the best of each house, or planet, together to see who can rise to the top and be worthy of being his knight by completing a series of necromantic challenges that turn into an evil game of Clue. Enter Gideon, who is a serf of the Ninth house. She's always wanted to escape the Ninth and is finally given the opportunity, but she has to go with her worst enemy. <br /><br />As for the book itself: it feels like a bad dream laced with scenes from Suckerpunch that takes place in a futuristic, bony Series of Unfortunate Events. It's a darkly whimsical, severe setting that the author takes care the entire book to remind you you're trapped in. This book is unique above all else, in writing style, tone; I loved the authorial voice and the humor. I didn't forget the entire time this wasn't your average space ship or futuristic world. It truly feels different. <br /><br />Past the writing, or maybe because of it I did come across a few issues. Most of all, while not dense I found the story hard to follow and hard to pay attention to. It took me far longer than it normally does with any other adult book to read and that isn't a dig necessarily, but I wonder if it's because of the uniqueness of the authorial voice or just I wasn't interested in some of it. <br /><br />All of that aside, Gideon as a concept was amazing and I loved her humor and her voice and her desire. She seemed really interesting and full fledged, as did Harrowhark. So I really cared about them the whole way through and seeing how they would react to the events. It's hard to make me enjoy a sci-fi and this one I really liked most of. The ending truly smacked and bang, especially the last few lines of the epilogue and by those lines I truly respected Gideon and enjoyed Harrowhark. <br /><br />I would recommend this if you know that this isn't a romance and is just a new, inventive sci fi."

      "review": "my main complaint about gideon the ninth is that i found it exceedingly hard to care about gideon the ninth<br /><br />there are certain aspects of this book i enjoyed: the world building is conceptually interesting, there are intriguing side characters, the writing is occasionally clever and sharp and i'm a fan of And Then There were None style murder mysteries. but every positive is weighed down by about twice the number of negatives. <br /><br />first there's the worldbuilding: it's an interesting setting for a dark science fantasy book and it follows a logic that's relatively easy to piece together (at least it was for me personally, but then i generally enjoy untangling the underlying rules of fantasy settings). but any actual descriptions are sparse at best and those that exist are solely to remind you how dark and edgy and goth the setting is, just in case you've forgotten the last time it was mentioned about two paragraphs ago. its bizarre how the book somehow manages to both overexplain and underexplain its setting at the same time. i would have loved some descriptions of the various houses' necromantic traditions and cultures or some clarity for the many terms thrown around without context, but here we get to the next problem:<br /><br />the protagonist. gideon is the kind of brazen, impulsive, compulsively wise-cracking YA protagonist who is perhaps interesting if you are also a teenager and would not be out of place as the main character of a shounen manga. but if you're any further down the development of your prefrontal cortex, she just comes across as aggravatingly immature and painfully short-sighted.<br /><br />her only discernible personality traits are making bad jokes, leering at any woman who walks by regardless of ongoing circumstances like recent homicides and being really good at swords. because the book is written from her point of view and because she has one brain cell and a complete disinterest in necromancy, we get no explanations on anything related to necromancy. personally i think it was a maybe sub-optimal choice to have a protagonist who doesn't care about necromancy in a book entirely about necromancy.<br /><br />then there's her relationship with harrow. they start off as hating each other 'with the passion of a thousand suns' - i was entirely perplexed by how this relationship was presented as a rivalry/mutual hatred since the book opens with gideon as an indentured servant to harrow's house, referred to as the \"house's property\". it's a relationship gideon has spent her whole life desperately trying to escape. this is a horribly toxic power imbalance to start with and it's one that is never addressed at all. for all her bravado, it's apparent that gideon has some deep-rooted self worth issues and <input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"spoiler__control\" aria-label=\"The following text has been marked spoiler. Toggle checkbox to reveal or hide.\" onchange=\"this.labels[0].setAttribute('aria-hidden', !this.checked);\" id=\"579c63da-3319-4013-8221-2cd10dc8e786\" /><label aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"spoiler\" for=\"579c63da-3319-4013-8221-2cd10dc8e786\"> the book ends with her dying for harrow, fulfilling the role she's spent her whole life being beaten into, which only cementing this fact. harrow's backstory is actually quite interesting and adds a lot of dimension to her character but i hate the way it is essentially there to go \"well see, harrow's not cruel for nothing, she's sad!\" okay and? that doesn't excuse the way she treats gideon? there's no organic progression to their relationship: a switch is flipped after a teary confession where harrow literally refers to gideon as her slave but says she feels bad about it all - gideon's magnanimousness moves harrow into apology for a decade of torment and that's it, all is forgiven. </label> i'm all for complicated and messy romances, but it's frustrating how often books introduce stark one-sided power dynamics between characters to add to \"sexual tension\" and then entirely gloss over it once they 'fall in love', as if that dynamic can ever be removed from their relationship. that's not even touching the fact that harrow is white and gideon is not. (edit: apparently they're both mixed maori as confirmed by word of god which is hilarious given that harrow is only ever described as pale and their maori heritage is never brought up.)<br /><br />in terms of representation: for a book written in the 2010s, the author sure is neck-deep in eurocentric beauty ideals. there's books with predominantly white casts ... and then there's books where the author waxes poetic about how every pretty girl has Light Eyes Light Hair Pale Skin. gideon the ninth is the latter and it was disquieting to read. having lesbian/bisexual characters openly talk about their sexual attraction towards women is great but gideon reads like a caricature, ogling at every single female character in the book and being really into 'rude magazines'. makes you wonder how the writer sees butch brown lesbians. <br /><br />while i enjoyed the overall writing style, the out-of-left-field references to 21st century memes were really jarring and immersion breaking. ive seen people raving about them, but i found it cartoonishly tropey and often times just inappropriate for the atmosphere of the scene. gideon's sense of humor is obnoxious and annoying to read through. there were also near constant references to anatomical terms that i imagine were tedious to wade through for anyone not well versed in medicine and biology, moreso because they were completely irrelevant to either plot or worldbuilding. <br /><br />i'm so aggravated! this book stayed with me after i read it because the world and setting is ripe with potential and all of it was poured down the drain of a juvenile protagonist and a superficial lust-story."

      "review": "Gideon Nav has been essentially captive in the Ninth House for her whole life. Now, she finally has the chance to leave- but only if she accompanies her sworn enemy, necromancer Harrowhark Nonagesimus, to join necromancers from the other seven houses to train towards greatness. Not only is this art of dead “raising” dangerous, but Gideon assumes the role of Harrowhark’s cavalier, a protector that usually has much more training than she does. The danger and secrets are not helped by Gideon and Harrowhark’s fraught relationship.<br /><br />Pros:<br />•This book flipped some of my typical fantasy book expectations for sure: there are plenty of badass female warriors, more female characters than men, no discussion of gender (it’s understood in their world that women can be powerful), and casual queer representation- it’s mentioned without being the focus because romance isn’t the focus<br />•The characters were so spunky and fun. Especially Gideon- her smartmouth and love for puns endeared her to me quickly. I loved the difference between her and Harrow and their complex relationship<br />•The ending! I have mixed feelings but it was a bold and appropriate, and not what I expected<br />•Overall, the book was pretty fast-paced with a fun cast of characters and very different from anything I’ve read. Note, I’m not much of a fantasy reader so take that with a grain of salt<br /><br />Cons:<br />•I’m personally not super into reading about action scenes, especially once the necromancy stuff started getting specific my eyes kind of glazed over. Also, the tasks that the necromancers were working on were too complex for the reader to totally follow. It seemed like we were going to learn more than we did, but we learned too many details of the journeys towards the keys to totally ignore them.<br />•Gideon and Harrow’s pure hatred of each other was cartoonish and silly. Their relationship got better, but felt very unrealistic at the beginning<br /><br />Recommendation: I recommend for fantasy lovers who want badass female characters beyond just one token badass female character. This is like the Hunger Games meets...The Nightmare Before Christmas?? Or something with necromancy. It throws you right into the world, but there is a glossary and character guide to help you out if you get too lost. Overall, a fun, different read for me with endearing characters. My main issues with the book stem from the genre itself, so avoid if you don’t want world building or want to be able to work out some of the plot points alongside characters.<br />"

It does start to get better midway through, but many times I had to re-read what the author wrote to grasp what the characters were doing. The verbiage got too much at times. <br />I liked the main character, she could be pretty sassy, but the author never seemed to flesh her out completely in the story and something felt off. There are also many loose ends by the time you finish the book and it leaves you just as confused as you started.<br /><br />This may also be a personal opinion, but after reading this novel I found myself left with the feeling of being queer baited. Sure, a female character casually crushes on a girl for a little bit. But it goes nowhere, is never discussed besides occasional teasing from some, and is lost in the scramble of all the action and puzzles characters face throughout the book.<br /><br />Postive notes - great horror feel, action scenes are interesting if you grasp them the first read, and Camilla was awesome. There are many kicka** women in this story.<br /><br />Overall, read this book if you like the paranormal, horror genre, and being kept on edge. Do not read for the LGBT representation it bragged about on the cover or romance because there is basically none."

      "review": "<em>Gideon the Ninth </em>is honestly unlike anything I’ve ever read. It’s perhaps one of the weirdest mixes of space, magic, murder mystery, and dystopian society in a book ever. Though I struggled to get into it, the sarcastic humor of titular character Gideon, and her amazing relationship with her friend/rival/enemy Harrow, combined with the sheer originality of the content was what sucked me into the novel.<br><br><em>Gideon the Ninth </em>takes place in a world that is governed by the undying Emperor, his most powerful necromancers, known as lyctors, and his army the Cohort. Serving him are nine houses of different varieties of necromancers, which are spread across the universe. When the Emperor summons the heirs of the nine houses to compete to become lyctors, the book becomes a very deadly game, filled with murder, mystery, and political battles between houses. Honestly, it feels like reading about the necromancers of <em>Elder Scrolls </em>in a <em>Hunger Games</em> scenario. <br><br><blockquote>\n  <em>“You forget yourself, Gideon Nav,” her teacher said shortly. “You’re no slave, but you’ll serve the House of the Ninth until the day you die and then thereafter, and you’ll commit no sin of perfidy in my air. \"</em>\n</blockquote><br><br><br>Gideon, who grows up as something of a servant for the dismal Ninth House, finds herself trapped into the role of cavalier to her most bitter rival and heir to the Ninth House, Harrowhark in her quest to become a lyctor. As a cavalier, Gideon must defend and serve Harrow, who she’s hated for her entire existence--brandishing a rapier and knuckles to protect her. Gideon finds herself protecting her against not only the other houses, but also the ancient and deadly experiments laying in the decaying mansion on the First House planet. These experiments point to powerful and lost necromancy techniques that hold the key becoming a lyctor.<br><br><br>The mystery of the secrets in the mansion were really interesting and intriguing to me. It only got more interesting as members of the other houses started turning up dead, unable to be revived by necromancers. But what captured my interest the most was the characters of the book and their relationships. Sadly, for the life of me, I cannot tell you who was a member of what house though. Even though <em>Gideon the Ninth </em>helpfully provides a chart of the members of each house at the beginning of the novel, I was doomed, even with references back to it. Each member of every house is referred to by their first name, last name, house numbers, such as “sextus,” and other names, which made it literally impossible for me to keep everybody straight.<br><br><br>Despite my eternal confusion at which character was which, the author still managed to make me really care about her characters, their decisions, and their relationships. For me the standout of <em>Gideon the Ninth, </em>was the friendship between Gideon and Harrow. The two started out hating each other’s guts, were trapped together on a planet with no one else they could trust, and forced to help each other survive. I absolutely loved the progression of their bond and development of these characters.<br><br><blockquote>\n  <em>“Isn’t this the part where you give me intel,” Gideon said, standing up and flexing her stiff muscles, “tell me all you know of the tasks ahead, who we’re with, what to expect?\"<br><br>“God, no!” said Harrow. “All you need to know is that you’ll do what I say, or I’ll mix bone meal in with your breakfast and punch my way through your gut.” Which was, Gideon had to admit, entirely plausible</em>\n</blockquote><br><br><br>I freaking loved Gideon. She was such a piece of work, sassing anything and everything--even making “that’s what she said” jokes--bettering others who had actually trained their whole lives as cavaliers in a duel, and proving herself at every turn.  Not only is she a capable warrior, but an empathetic person, so it’s no surprise when she falls for the fatally ill necromancer, Dulcinea of the Seventh House, despite Harrow’s disapproval. Though I wasn’t nearly as invested in Gideon’s crush on Dulcinea as I was with her relationship with Harrow, it definitely went down an interesting path. And that’s all I will say to that, cuz spoilers.<br><br><blockquote>\n  <em>Dulcinea had the dreamy, confiding manner of someone who, despite spouting grade-A horseshit, was confident you would understand everything she was saying.”</em>\n</blockquote><br><br>So on top of all the other genres in the book--science fiction, dystopian society, coming of age, mystery, suspense, horror--there’s also LGBT+ romance.  I honestly don’t understand how the author combined so many genres in one book--I’m still in awe--and made it such a coherent and gripping story. It was also initially off-putting that there was so much modern day slang in fantasy novel, but once I got used to it, I really enjoyed it. My only other complaint with <em>Gideon the Ninth, </em>besides my inability to keep the cast of characters straight, was that there wasn’t more time spent on world-building. I barely understood what type of necromancy each house used, where these house planets were, how they co-existed, how/why the Emperor was undying, and why he needed new lyctors.<br><br>Perhaps this lack of exposition was a definitive choice on the author’s part in order to drive home the point of what black sheep the Ninth House were, and how their tomb-like planet and way of life voluntarily isolated from the rest of the world. I see that as entirely plausible, as any one who can successfully weave so many genres together, complete with modern slang, is truly a master of their craft. Like the rest of the novel, I also found the descriptions in the book peculiar, unsettling, and engrossing: <br><br><blockquote>\n  <em>The man who’d put the sword to her neck was uncomfortably buff. He had upsetting biceps. He didn’t look healthy; he looked like a collection of lemons in a sack.</em>\n</blockquote><br><br>The author does such a great job of describing things in an utterly unique way that almost shouldn’t make sense, but somehow does. So despite the lack of time spent on world-building and the fact that I couldn't even keep all of the characters straight, I was entirely invested until the very last page of <em>Gideon the Ninth.</em> I know a lot of other readers found the ending unsatisfying, but I didn’t. To me, the entire reason that Gideon ended up being a cavalier was for her own freedom and independence, and in my eyes, that was something she gained. <input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"spoiler__control\" aria-label=\"The following text has been marked spoiler.

To me, no one forced Gideon into that decision, it was her choice, and what she always wanted--to choose her own destiny. I felt that the book was leading up to Gideon and Harrow becoming one the being, a lyctor, the entire time, what with the ancient experiments, and Harrow and Gideon’s making peace with each other.</label> And I’m really excited to see what role Gideon will play in the sequel <em>Harrow</em>, which I frankly needed yesterday.<br><br>If you love to escape into worlds in your books,Gideon the Ninth, will suck you into a wholly unique experience. When I say this novel truly has something for everyone, I mean it, and fans of any genre should be able to find something that speaks to them in <em>Gideon the Ninth </em>as easily as necromancers speak to the dead.<br><br><a href=\"https://www.bloggingwithdragons.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">\n  <img src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1591938069i/29633023.png\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\">\n</a><br><a href=\"https://www.bloggingwithdragons.com//\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Bloggingwithdragons.com</a><br><a href=\"https://www.bloggingwithdragons.com//books/book-review-policy/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"> My Book Review Policy</a></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]>"

      "review": "Sometimes a book is just vibes, and sometimes those vibes are just bones.<br /><br />Ok, first let's answer one of the most difficult questions: What is actually going on in this book?? <br /><br />You may have heard of the tagline 'Lesbian necromancers explore a haunted mansion in space' - which, yes, is true. But while those aspects are present in the book, it is not necessarily just about them.<br />Yes, the characters are queer and sapphic, but it is not a story about falling and being in love. (Okay, it has the building blocks for a lesbian relationship, but geez, those kids are not alright.) It is a story set in space, but space is - in the first book - no more than a background setting piece, and the story doesn't follow the usual sci-fi storybeats. Yes, an haunted house is here too, but again, this is just a setting piece and is there to elude to backstory mysteries - what about the murders? The murders are not even mentioned.<br />The tagline compromises a few aspects into eye catchers, but seeing that many people have a hard time getting into Gideon the Ninth, it feels like those eye catchers rather end up misleading the reader. It is catchy tho, I admit. <br /><br />Another description as by the author: Why jocks and nerds can never be friends. <br /><br />Ok, let's try again.<br />In this sci-fi setting, some people are capable of necromancy. But necromancy comes with the price of being physically as strong as a rotten tomato, so each Necromancer has a Cavalier - basically a designated sword buddy - who acts as their bodyguard.<br />Enter Gideon, an indentured servant to the struggling Ninth House, which is made up by the House's heir, Harrow - Gideon's childhood nemesis -, elders, and many skeletons. With the opportunity presented to save the House and obtain Lyctorhood - basically super necromancy - Harrow forces our heroine Gideon to help her in this endeavor.<br />Traveling to another planet, they meet the necromancers and caveliers of the other Houses in a mysterious challenge, and, well, nobody is really trustworthy. And even worse, Gideon and Harrow have to work together in earnest to stay alive and unravel the mystery of the house (and their relationship). <br />Hauntings, and queer (partially hostile) yearning, and murder and bone magic tricks happen. <br /><br /><br />The best way to engage with this book - this whole series - is to put trust in it. And the trust will be rewarded. <br /><br />I found the beginning of the novel harsh. The reader is thrown into this necromancy flavored sci-fi setting with little to no explanation and new worldbuilding aspects are still being delivered in each stage of the book - and I can understand if this feels frustrating.<br />According to the author, this feeling is a feature and not a bug, and my reading experience improved a lot when I started just vibing with the book. And let me say it, the book is so much fun.<br />I don't mind the abrupt beginning that much anymore, because I don't think anybody would have enjoyed the alternative, this being info-dumping. <br />I also came to like that the book took enough time in the first section to introduce the main character, do it well, and illustrate her relationships with her home and the people living there before jumping into more necromancy action later.<br />I was aware of some major spoilers before starting the book - did they help me figure out the story and mystery? Hahaha no. But it is always a plus for me if one can enjoy a series even if you have been spoilered. <br /><br />I admit, I struggled at first with the writing style because it was one I wouldn't enjoy reading in my mother tongue. But even with that personal disadvantage, the writing grows on you, and Gideon as a narrator is wonderful. <br /><br />Once I was more secure in the worldbuilding and setting, I really started falling in love with the book. I just loved the characters and their dynamics, and Gideon is such a delightful, wholesome bastard of a character. And her relationship with Harrow? Harrow, arrogant, imposter-syndrome, with the life motto that there exits no problem that can't be solved with enough bones? Chef's kiss. <br />Each book in the series features an unreliable narrator. Gideon is one because she only pays attention to sword fighting, cool women and Harrow, which, I mean, fair. <br /><br />This is a book unlike any other I've encountered. I love how the author lays the groundwork for multiple mysteries, some of which will come to fruition only in the later books, which I found very engaging.<br />A more honest rating would be 4 stars, but my enjoyment of the book easily pushes it to 5."

It's pretty rare to see a sci-fi/horror/fantasy novel written like this, with no fake deep reverence.

Even Harrow, who's presented as pretty dour, has some really funny comebacks in her witty report with Gideon. <br /><br />Also love that Gideon is a queer character where her sexuality doesn't dominate her character and her attraction to women is a non-issue, although I personally like more romance in my books - not something I hold against this book because I knew from the beginning it featured a sapphic character but wasn't a \"sapphic love\" story. <br /><br />I found the secrets and the pace at which we got them a little frustrating but in a good way. It made me want to keep reading (and I devoured the whole book in 2 days, so I think this was effective). <br /><br />Now for the not as good: <br /><br />I found the book really engaging but also really confusing. Very hard to follow who was who - I had to stop halfway through and make a character cheat sheet so I wouldn't have to keep going back to the Dramatis Personae. This is not helped by the constant referring to people as \"her necromancer\" or \"his cavalier\" - it serves to showcase the relationship between necromancer and cavalier but also, every character seems to go by at least 3 or 4 formal names in addition to the nicknames Gideon bestows on them, so it was all a bit hard to follow.<br /><br />Also hard to follow was all the technical descriptions of necromancy and the action sequences, especially the last \"boss battle.\" <br /><br />And finally - the ending. A huge bummer. As much as I liked this, I don't know if I'd be interested in reading it (or the others in the series) without Gideon's narration. And although again I will say I knew going in this was not a romance, I did find the ramp up and ending of Gideon and Harrow's relationship to be a bit unsatisfying. It wasn't really enemies to lovers as much as it was enemies, to unwilling allies, to maybe lukewarm allies, to enemies again, and then finally coming around to something resembling friends, which was unfortunately shortlived. I Know this book is not a romance but I was hoping for a bit more than that.<br /><br />It's a fun, Clue-like mystery with cool characters, really COOL character designs, great dialogue, but also can be confusing and depending on your expectations, little disappointing. Unsure if I'll read the sequel, but worth reading this one if horror is your bag."

      "review": "I know community is a lie because no one saw me with this book in my hand and told me gently to stop while I was ahead. Not one motherfucker protected me. <br /><br />WORSE, these fuckers called it a story about lesbian necromancers. I need us to use our words better. There's a difference between a lesbian story (exploring lesbian identity and politics), a lesbian romance story (featuring a prominent romance) and a story with a lesbian character, which is what this was. Gideon is a lesbian in passing and we need those too but man, I'm sick of falling for the hype-machine's mismarketing. <br /><br />For the first one-third, I found GTN interesting. By the end, I realized it was bulky and bloated, a collapsing cake held up only by Gideon’s wit and then that folds too and the cake fully splits. This is the tale of how I came to that conclusion. <br /> <br />Right off the bat, I was struck by how pointlessly wordy the narration was. And I'm not someone who complains about a story actually challenging them. I read like an editor but this was wordy in a way that worked less and less with each page. The narration was getting bogged down by the haphazardly strewn words, until you couldn't visualize the action. <br /><br />I’ve never had to break my thesaurus out before. GTN is verbose, through word choice and sentence construction, to the point of too much information and imagery so you struggle to conceptualize the environment. The description of the symbol above the forbidden door Gideon finds left me scratching my head because it didn't go top to bottom but bounced around different features, like the paneling below and then the symbol above. If it's disorienting as a camera movement, just imagine how it feels reading it. <br /><br />The writing has a strong clear voice but it's convoluted and struggling with clarity of phrase. It tends to litter the story with description willy-nilly, instead of carefully placing each detail in a sequence and then refining the construction until the fewest words convey the most. <br /><br />This problem with story construction isn't limited to the language. The story also often tries to withhold information for later to build suspense, but it's so poorly done that the present moment's description isn't clear. The example I recall right now is how Harrowhark's parents are first described in the narration. Their strange body language is poorly described so the narration can reveal that they're actually reanimated. I'm not saying the reveal shouldn't be done but it doesn't land 8 times out of 10. What's the point of a twist when a person can't even form a wrong impression you can debunk because the actual description is so unclear? <br /><br />The suspense being built is at the cost of reader comprehension. It conceals information so clumsily that the blatantly weird turn of phrase gives it away. It's only that weird because something is being concealed. <br /><br />For the first one-third, I was okay with the twist-reveal compulsion (I should have seen that giant red flag for what it was) and the clumsy writing because Gideon was a hoot of a protagonist. She was sardonic and witty. I burst out laughing at multiple points. I love pain in the ass brat protagonists. I even thought her bungling the first day running around the place was a refreshing change from other series protagonists who rarely make big fuckups and if they do, are quickly rescued before real damage can be done. I liked seeing Gideon's horror at fucking up. <br /><br />The parts that had to come together for Gideon's first-day bungling to make sense showed careful thought and care. Harrow hated her and was equally arrogant about how she can maneuver them both through the situation without confiding in Gideon, Gideon is not in her element, everyone is nosing about her because the Ninth is so far away and never gets visited. But that sort of care faded away as the story progressed. I understand that everything doesn’t need to be explained; I don't want to be Cinema Sin-ning a story. But some things do. Like why do the priests never intervene? Why are they never even expected to? Why are there no hints about why they don’t intervene (like the countless hints about how the emperor can’t return?) Shouldn't these be questions the characters have? Questions they demand answers to? Maybe the story will only answer them later but I would like the narration to acknowledge those questions and then to skirt answers for an in-world logical reason. <br /><br />Why were the spaceships knocked off the shore? Why does Gideon never ask this question? Why were people not permitted to return after landing? One person tried asking this but we forgot. Why are there no communications off the planet? I feel like the Seconds should be really baffled by this. Why is all of this important in the novel if it isn’t actually addressed towards the end? Why does the story acknowledge all this and then do nothing with it? <br /> <br />Given how little the Ninth is visited by outsiders (and even less for reproduction), why are Gideon’s eyes and hair not immediately remarked upon for their atypical coloring except by one? Why does no one notice? Have they not even read about what the usual coloring is? The travel ceased very recently. Surely the older members (which is most of them) would raise an eyebrow. <br /><br />I didn't start asking these questions until two-thirds through because I thought everything would be clarified in due time. When the villain reveal (and we'll get to that) happened with no real set-up, just proper smacked me in the face without warning, I realized I would be getting jack-shit. <br /><br />Gideon's jokes had been helping me ignore some of the story's weaknesses up until then, but it was grating on me by the halfway point. The story was overdoing Gideon’s humor, adding it to scenes where it didn't belong and jarringly disrupted the flow, such as her fuck-you responses to the Eighth after a very traumatic event. Not only was the comeback not funny on its own, it was tonally dissonant from the rest of the scene. Not in a Gideon-is-avoiding way but in a oh-the-story-doesn't-realize-this-sounds-off way. The humor starts feeling absurd, as in discordant and pointless. <br /><br />When the violence really begins, you see just how badly things don’t land because the tone is all over the place. The fights are lackluster and overwhelming with unstructured detail, so we're out on the action genre count too. Most deaths don’t generate emotional impact because so much stuff keeps happening. The packed cast that initially excited me (because I love a good group story) bogged the story down and the narration treats them with little regard right back, not letting relationships actually form. The surface-level impressions of other characters remain impressions, because you just observe them from a distance. At most, Gideon develops some warm feelings. She never slowly enters into deep meaningful connection with them, is not changed by them, until she's suddenly all up in their business because of certain events and then just as fast, she's out of it. We just get flashes whizzing past us. <br /><br />I was okay with information being withheld because I thought this story was at least partially a mystery, but a mystery is as much about REVEALING information as it is about concealing it. A reader should be able to guess the twist if clever enough but the many MANY serendipitous things that happen for the villain to go undetected until confronted aren't even hinted at. Congratulations, you can guess who the villain is but you will NEVER guess the reason for their villainy because we know nothing about them until they start introducing themselves. I'm still unclear on why the villain reveal was such a major part of the story; why are you hamming it up with the suspense when you clearly don't want to be a mystery? <br /><br />Initially, I liked how many villains, switches and feints we got. I thought we were in for a good evolving mystery — but then it turns out to not be a mystery. You can’t predict who the villain is because everyone is just doing stuff and all information about how people like them could have existed, how they could have ended up in this story at this point in time, is withheld. After some point, things are just happening of their own accord and you sigh because you can't get off the ride until it ends. Characters speak obliquely or make no sense when explaining twists or reasoning (looking at two women specifically). The story doesn’t acknowledge that confusion or lack of clarity so it feels like the author is trying to dodge explaining things by writing bizarre dialogue that doesn't shed any light and hoping the readers won’t notice. <br /><br />And what a villain revealed! The final confrontation was so cheesy and over the top. The villain is practically frothing at the mouth to do their big speech. I thought it was hammy to begin with and then the twist happened and I had no idea how bad it could get. Once the final showdown starts, the story relaxes because it can finally devolve from a densely packed story with a rich world into a Wattpad/Star Plus drama where shit just keeps happening with no room to breathe. The difference between the two is a matter of how the foundation is laid and the structure is built. You can hit me with an eighteen-wheeler of drama and I'll cheer IF IT'S DONE WELL. There should be set-up, pay-off, lead-up!!! When we do too much with too little structure, we tip over into melodrama territory. <br /><br />I don't know what broke my heart with more vengeance: the garbage villain reveal or the completely lackluster two-page romance. Can you imagine getting hit with this hollow, unearned development when you don't have an SSN and have taxes to file in less than a month? Can you imagine what it does to you to know you spent your time on a book like this instead? Gideon and Harrowhark’s conflict is at the heart of the story and I enjoy it but it’s resolved with such a piss poor explanation. The explanation is not just a cheap shot to absolve Harrowhark of her cruelty instead of letting her actually atone over time, but what we DO find out is not unpacked. Why was Gideon trained so extensively as a FIGHTER if the royals feared her? Of all things, why arm your worst fear? <br /><br />How do you just drop that guilt if it's actual, severe guilt? Why was that guilt not hinted at earlier? How does Gideon’s hatred turn so easily to deep affection after so many years of cruelty? Harrowhark was her singular tormentor and held absolute power over her. The glimpses we get at Gideon’s ‘feelings’ for Harrowhark don’t feature any depth or complexity. It’s just one slapstick overreaction after another as if the story is putting it off for later, not real confusion, reflection, fear, revulsion, shame, etc. We’re thrown headfirst into their romance and I didn’t hit the ground running; I got the wind knocked out of me and laid there, unable to move.<br /> <br />Harrowhark’s feelings for Gideon are only expressed through some jealousy every now and then. We don’t see any complexity or troubledness from her either, given what she's done to Gideon for almost 2 decades. Her shame and anger dissolve away immediately. I love a good redemption arc. I love when characters fall for each other after hunting each other like Bloodhounds. I loved Cardan and Jude with a fierce passion because the story acknowledged the weight of what they'd done to each other. It kept tipping that weight back and forth and it was smart enough to know when to stop. None of that slow gradual development happens here. Nothing is complex. <br /><br />But the worst is yet to come, because I was getting upset when I hadn't even finished the novel. I have no words for how the ending came down on me. Even though certain setting descriptions made me feel like I was struggling through an architectural digest, I persisted. WOE IS ME FOR DOING SO. I have tears in my eyes not from grief but from the shock of how many hours I spent reading this story for it to amount to nothing. Now I have to file my taxes once I recover from the stupefaction of experiencing this ending. <br /><br />I've had this ending happen to me before and it was just as badly done then. Maybe someone out there is talented enough and knows how to weave good reasons for this second twist into the story from the beginning, so it lands well when it happens. But both these times, I've only felt a hollow kind of betrayal. It felt like it was done purely for shock. <br /><br />Just like with the The Jasmine Throne, we have too much happening in GTN that’s supposed to help with the next books that’s not actually useful to the current one (Abigail’s poking around and subsequent death, the constant emphasis on PRINCE Tern, the Teacher soul reveal). Additionally we also have characters that are apparently completely meaningless (what even is up with Corona except to be ogled at?) and take up valuable time. So we don’t get a properly developed relationship between Gideon and Harrowhark, just a whirlwind of information. And just like with The Jasmine Throne, I will not be reading the rest of the series. In fact, I felt vindicated in my melodrama assessment when I read the synopsis for the second. <br /><br />For the next two days after that cheap out-of-nowhere ending, I was Wile E. Coyote after taking an anvil to the head. Fool me once. If my rage could be in the driver's seat again, I would give one star for that 'twist' alone. However, I have added an extra because the first one-third was semi-enjoyable. I liked it before I realized it was about to collapse in on me. "

      "review": "Gonna preface this by saying that even if this book was trash, I would still love it. I would still love it the way I love Pacific Rim because it delivered on giant robots punching giant aliens. Likewise, Gideon The Ninth totally delivered on the promise of gay necromancers exploring a haunted gothic palace in space, and that's all I could've asked for.<br /><br />I love sci-fi, I love wlw rep, I love campy horror, and I love creepy magic. So this is a review tinted by the rose colored glasses of this book ticking all those boxes. All the queer artists I follow on Twitter have been posting about this series for ages and I totally get it now.<br /><br />A lot of my enjoyment for this story is grounded in the fact that I loved Gideon and Harrow from the very start. Here we have two young, queer female leads who are so messy and deeply flawed, who are allowed the range to be off-putting, ridiculous, even gross. I might've found my own identity sooner had I seen more representation like this growing up.<br /><br />This isn't a perfect book and it won't work for everyone. It's a deeply strange story. The characters, the tone of voice, the campiness, they'll either work for you or they won't. We never really get a deep understanding of the universe it's set in, and lore is confusingly dropped with no context, as if it's the last in the trilogy rather than first. This is definitely no epic, sweeping adventure through the solar system, it's myopically focused on one story playing out in one location. The pacing, if you aren't sold on the characters and premise, will probably feel like it drags and then escalates sharply. It goes from a pleasant jog to Olympic sprint in the last two acts when all the big reveals start dropping left and right, but I was fully on board for the whole ride.<br /><br />In conclusion, if you're a gay ass nerd like me, you're gonna love this."

      "review": "Reading Gideon The Ninth is like stepping into a labyrinth with a creepily eerie feeling that trickles down your skin as you navigate through it without an ounce of knowledge of what lies ahead. What the author nailed in this read is putting her readers in Gideon's shoes and alongside her, I too feel the confusion, fear and the constant self-distrust of my mind in choosing to believe what has been laid out in front of me. In moments that you think you're closer to the truth, Ms.Muir pushes you through another door and presents you with a new maze. In a read that is so utterly mind-boggling and mind-bending, I was tumbling down the wormhole and there is no stopping from knowing what’s certain and what's not. This book just jives with me and affects me in a way that's difficult to put in words. I dream about it this when I wasn't reading it, I squeezed in time just to read a damn page. It never dragged, never wallowed, and never let me down. <br /><br />The audiobook? Superb. I'm in awe of Moira Quirk's ability of narrating, to describe things, make them seem alive and real. She doesn't just tell a story, she grabs you by the goddamn collar and drags into the device, places you in the story and makes you watch, suffer, love and hate together with the characters.<br /><br />There is not animal attraction or insta-lust that binds Gideon and Harrow. It's a deal, it's business that turns into a friendship that turns into an unconditional trust that turns into a parade of unicorns that shit peanut butter cups and Snickers bars. The banters between the Cavalier and her Necromancer - there are so many great one-liners disburse throughout this gem. I was reading them out loud to anyone who were in my vicinity. Undoubtedly, among the ganache on the amazingly delicious Gideon The Ninth cake is the fabulously witty dialogues and the verbal ping-pong matches between Gideon and Harrow. Together and individually, Gideon and Harrow are amazing. I ached for them. I cried with them. I wanted to pray for the bad to go away and leave them alone. I never felt so related to the couple I've read about. They made it so easy to love and hurt for them. My skin is still buzzing with this feelings.<br /><br /><br />There are a abundance of amazing world-building and imagery in this book, some of my favorite parts about it. They are written in such a way that I could see the landscape so clearly in my head as I go oooh, aaah, no way, are you for real, Shit! Do not go there at the special effects. What I love so much about Muir's writing is, she makes the abnormal seem normal; nothing is impossible in this book and almost everything left to imagination becomes reality. There is also this theme of exploring deeper, hidden meanings, to look at something and discover a different angle about it, to delve into one matter and uncover an entirely new dimension. A GREAT setting that acts as its own character.<br /><br /><br />The most minor of details can be the most major of spoilers. The book is that cleverly woven together and twisted. Talking about this book is like trying to describe to someone a relationship from long ago that was bittersweet and is now over, but I have never had a relationship that involved so many necromancers and swordplay, not even metaphorically and fewer people might care about my love life than about this book.<br /><br /><br />Stories are defined by a beginning, a middle, and an end. In more literary circles, people talk about denouements and layers, textures, the way a word can transcend to a synesthetic experience. But at the end of day, it all comes back down to those three things. A beginning, a middle, an end.<br />You’d be amazed as to how much detail gets lost in between, how a good storyteller can make you forget the bits that don’t make sense.<br /><br />Harrow The Ninth will be out in August, all editions added to wishlist and praying for a miracle that Ms.Muir will think of publishing the graphic novel/s. If you are worried about the freaking 11 letter word ending, don't, trust me. F rated it 5, the other 2 Fantasy Gurus - LK and PL have yet to read them but Carrie wrote a damn good love gushing letter to it....you're still here?"

      "review": "It's difficult to describe this book. Genres like \"dark gothic sci-fi mystery adventure\" are a start but it's so much more than that.<br /><br />I'd say it's a character driven drama wrapped in a murder mystery wrapped in long-form court intrigue wrapped in a techno morgue hallucination.<br />What ties all of this together is some of the most vivid, surreal and textured writing I've ever found. <br /><br />All this to say that I unexpectedly adored this book and found it distinctly memorable.<br /><br />With some caveats though: Gideon the Ninth is a heavy, dense read. Luckily even without being invested in the expansive world and really crafty intrigue there is said murder mystery that is really enjoyable on its own. So, it's a heavy read but a very rewarding one. <br /><br />Originally I approached this for the romance. Others have warned that it doesn't take center stage and while true I wasn't disappointed with that aspect at all. If quiet moments and longing spell out romance for you you'll enjoy it here too.<br /><br /> <input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"spoiler__control\" aria-label=\"The following text has been marked spoiler.

Lifelong resident of House nine, a glorified church, built up a lot of spite and she channels it into tiny acts of rebellion and big acts of daring escape attempts. She's endearing all the way down. You'll laugh at the crass jokes, you'll roll your eyes at Gideon's inability to tell when people flirt with her, you'll cry your eyes out at how far she will to protect others.<br /><br />Ultimately nothing escapes the Head of the House, Harrowhark. Spindly build yet a sharp mind and particular penchant for raising the dead makes her consistently the most dangerous person in the room. Underestimating her is a lethal mistake yet even the reader engages in it.<br />First impressions make her seem cold and stuck-up but that's just one of the many conflicting identities that define Harrow. <br />A young and broken woman, a Leader of generations and someone still carrying a lost childhood love; regardless of aspect all of them feature incredibly inspired character writing.<br />Who is Harrow, a rhetoric question with many answers and even after the book ends a question I'm still stuck on. <br /><br />Their relationship seems hostile at first but ends up deeply layered and forms the emotional core for much of the book. Once close friends they now share a deep separation, Harrow carrying resentment and an entire legacy on her shoulders while Gideon wants to experience the outside world yet remaining attached to so much of her old life. <br />Harrow and Gideon's dynamic is addictive and the few moments they share not with passion but with genuine understanding and momentary solace were my favorite parts of the book. <br /><br />Opportunity strikes when Harrow is invited to represent her house in a competition for the only thing that matters in a world obsessed with death, immortality. Without any other decent candidates she offers Gideon freedom in exchange for one outing as her cavalier (a knight bodyguard of sorts)<br /><br />Both are off to the giant palace that houses said challenge. The pacing slows down considerably and the reader gets an opportunity to learn about the world and the other house's representatives. <br /><br />What starts off as friendly mingling between competitors changes drastically as the \"game is revealed\"; whoever solves five trials first gets the prize. On top of that somehow people keep ending up dead. <br />Small talk at dinner gets stripped bare to reveal the probing for weakness it always was and the urgent desperation it contains. <br />The reader gets the sense more and more characters are willing to do whatever it takes to be the last one standing and that none of them will leave alive.<br /><br />As an avid reader of whodunits this was superb. The stakes ramp up gradually and the increasingly Machiavellian tone keeps the gears in your head turning faster and faster. Paying attention gets rewarded however in the end the (extensive) twists do make sure everyone has caught up to the story. <br /><br />As things unravel and certainty of who is actually on Gideon's side increasingly becomes a luxury the author leans heavier into the surreal tones. One chapter in particular, as Gideon wanders the halls in a daze and the other contestants seem comfortable with flashing their murderous and deceitful aspects, was just magnificent. Rare that i read a chapter twice just for the joy of it. <br /><br />The conclusion of the book will probably divide people. I wasn’t fond of the more formulaic character conclusion but it also wrapped everything up so perfectly. Ultimately it left me satisfied but wanting more and that's as good as endings get.<br /><br /> </label><br /><br />What a fantastic ride that left me eager for the sequel.<br /><br />To sum up, if anything I've listed here sounds appealing I'd give this book a shot. It will surprise you in the best ways."

      "review": "I didn't like this book, but I see why people do.<br /><br />The mystery is well written and compelling. Could not stop reading it, because I really wanted to solve. Couldn't guess what was going to happen next, most of the revelations were a total surprise. I get the impression the Gideon's character and the YA coming-of-age plot was thrown in last minute because it was profitable for the time, I don't think it fits very well with the rest of the setting or theme. There's much adult swearing and lots and lots of gore. Heavy emphasis on gore.<br /><br />90 percent necromancy (and why/how it's super unhealthy, which is very interesting), 15 percent lesbians (there's 2? 3? At least 1, but no romance, would not call this a Lesbian book because there's hardly any of it) and 2 percent sci-fi. Unique and strange world that we get a glimpse of but can definitely tell there's a lot more under the surface, with an interesting magic system. None of the world or mechanics are explained, but I didn't mind.<br /><br />Weakness is the characters. Gideon's motivation changes depending on what the plot needs her to want--acceptance, family, glory, etc. She doesn't drive the plot, she's fairly inconsistent in her reactions (what she's afraid of, her reaction to pain, based on what Plot needs), and saves the day because she's the Main Character. She doesn't have enough agency or goals to be a protagonist (which is Harrow), and if you remove Gideon from the story completely, the mystery almost completely works the same. She isn't needed. She's not quite a Watson narrator, but it's a close thing.<br /><br />Her sense of humor developed in a vacuum, clash hard against the aesthetics of everything else. It doesn't match anything or anyone in the novel. It's very out of place, though it's a nice foil against all the gloom. Her comics and porn mags also developed in a vacuum, and don't fit the Evil Empire Colonists world, but whatever. Her tragic backstory isn't a personality, but it tries really hard. Gideon at the Beginning of novel is a different character from Gideon at the End, but the development is half-hazard and lazy, and I really think she wasn't supposed to be in this story at all. Might be the writer doesn't know how to do a character arc, because none of the 20+ characters have a believable arc.<br /><br />Her rivalry/hatred with sister/GF/Master seemed overblown for the sake of drama, and motivation for mutual rivalry never believable. It's almost *entirely* Telling instead of Showing, without nuance or subtext or even concrete examples. For so much text with Gideon and Harrow (and there's a LOT of text, this is a long book), not much happens.<br /><br />Her reconciliation with Harrow isn't believable, because whatever the cause, their relationship as *shown* in the Plot is definitely abusive and codependent, with concrete examples. I'm *told* they've been Abusive and apathetic for years, without actually liking or caring for each other. That's not something solved with a couple hugs and confessions, except the book makes it happen, because of Required Plot Beats. <br /><br />I'm annoyed with lazy writing and the cheap payoff, which is why I keep harping on it. But it doesn't affect the mystery. The mystery kept me reading. This book would have been SO much better if it was just mystery, much cleaner and sharper.<br /><br />Majority of relationships in story are abusive and codependent, to varying degrees, which makes a ton of sense considering the characters' world. I can't tell if the author is romanticizing abuse, I suspect she is. The economy is built on death and death magic, and they're running out of things to kill. Everyone is generally desperate and selfish, and those relationships are natural results of such behavior. Unhealthy relationships and desperate people make sense in this world, but I don't enjoy reading about them."

To my disappointment however, it didn’t work for me.<br /><br />I felt really disconnected throughout the book, couldn’t picture anything in my head (characters, setting, action sequences, you name it), i was confused and even irritated from time to time. The writing style did not work for me at all - again, i felt as if i couldn’t quite grasp what was happening. The only enjoyable parts of the narration were the comedic touches in Gideon’s voice.<br /><br />I am mostly disappointed bcs this was one of my highly anticipated reads and i believed i would love it. It was marketed as “lesbian necromancers in space” or “enemies to lovers gay in space”. You will find plenty of necromancers, bones, skeletons and other undead shit, as well as the “space” part: this is sci fi after all. But I didn’t buy the romance - or rather, i felt no romance at all. The relationship between Gideon and Harrow (the supposedly enemies to lovers one) lacks the both enemies and the lovers sections. The author tells us that they hate each other in the beginning but it doesn’t feel believable. Throughout the shit that happens, they get closer and start trusting each other, but it was a rivals/childhood frenemies turned best friends relationship. Not an ounce of romance. I had read before that both gideon and harrow were gay - but if i hadn’t this prior knowledge, i couldn’t have picked it up from the book. There is too little romantic or sexual interaction between either these two characters, or them with someone else.<br /><br />The pacing was all over the place: the opening scene feels imo out of place, the action and the plot really begins around the 20% mark. Basically there are Nine Houses (planets) and each sends a necromancer and a cavalier to a creepy mansion to train and discover secrets in order to ascend and become Lyctors. The competition/training trope is one that i’m a sucker for, but again, i couldn’t enjoy it in this book.<br /><br />Didn’t care for the characters or the worldbuilding, the big revelations were meh, but i kept reading because i was curious to find out the ending. Don’t know if i should bother reading the sequels."

      "review": "<i>This review originally appeared on the book review blog: <a href=\"https://justonemorepaige.wordpress.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Just One More Pa(i)ge</a>. </i><br /><br />Well, I think we could all agree that I knew I’d be reading this one. Tagged as lesbian necromancers in space, there was really no more I needed to know. And all the awards it’s been nominated for since then really only reinforced what I already knew. In fact, this was in the stack of books I bought for myself with Holiday gift money back in January. I had hoped to get to it sooner, but I’m horrific at getting through TBR piles (not the mention the fact that I bought myself quite a few books at that time)…I blame it less on myself and more on how many amazing books are being published faster than I can keep up with them. Anyways, I’d also like to point out that this is the book I chose to use for The Reading Women Challenge 2020 prompt #22, “by a favorite or new-to-you publisher.” I freaking love Tor Books, so much, so this falls under the “favorite” option.<br /><br />Raised by the Ninth House after being “mysteriously” orphaned, Gideon is done with the reanimated corpses and old, unfriendly nuns. She is fully trained with her sword, has a stash of dirty magazines for the road, and is on her way to (finally) carrying out an escape plan. But her nemesis, Harrowhark Nonagesimus, Reverend Daughter of the Ninth House, has other plans. The Emperor needs new necromancers and Harrow is convinced that her talent is enough to win her the role that will bring new “life” and recognition to the failing Ninth House. But she has one need that only Gideon can help with – she needs a swordswoman. And though Gideon can’t think of anything she wants less that to serve Harrow any longer, the deal for freedom she strikes in exchange is impossible to pass up. And so Harrow and Gideon set off together to compete against the heirs of each of the other Houses to win the right to become one of the Emperor’s immortal, all-powerful servants. <br /><br />Whoa. Just whoa. First, I am on a role with fantastically entertaining (and fun) adult fantasy this year. First, The Ninth House by Leigh Bardugo and now this one. Randomly, they both have ninth in the title – weird trend. But yea, I loved this one. Almost from start to finish I read it was a smile on my face (minus some gory parts in the middle where things got a little grimace-y and one spot at the end where I surprised myself by how emotionally invested I got in some of the characters and their relationships to each other). Gideon’s snark was hilarious to read – it’s not often a character can come across so sarcastic in a way that doesn’t get old or feel forced – and it’s a style of humor that I gravitate towards in real life, with real people/friends, so I was into it here. I also got into Harrow’s particular brand of sour insult-y-ness. It fit her role and the story really well and played nicely with Gideon’s personal brand. All in all, both with Gideon and Harrow, but also with the rest of the characters, I thought the dialogue was great – smart and quick. Dialogue is always a major make or break for me with a novel and it was a big “make” here. And in line with that, the general writing and pacing was spot on. This was a fast-moving and diverting novel that really kept me wanting to turn pages. The generic parts of the plot (the competition against other “players” to win a coveted position) are really nothing ground-breaking, but the more individual aspects added in, like necromancy (not a magic I have read much about before, so the originality in that magic-system were super interesting for me) and the scientific/experimental characteristics of challenges were unique. Although there were maybe a few times where the more technical parts of the necromancy and/or the trials themselves lost me, the main ideas were clear enough to allow me to take the basic understanding I needed from them and rush headlong into the next plot point (which was really all I wanted to do). <br /><br />Moving more into the developmental pieces of the story, I really appreciated the two-person team set-up, with the relationships of the necromancers and their swords-people being integral to the success or failure of their “mission.” It allowed for some great character-building over the course of the story (I for sure got invested in some of the pairs from the other Houses), especially for our focal pair, Gideon and Harrow. Knowing that they entered this competition as mortal enemies (this is a pretty obvious development so I don’t think it’s a spoiler to touch on it), their enemies-to-friends (and maybe more?) development was stellar. It was never smooth, which is expected and realistic, and in fact it was often ugly and unhealthy and kind of awful(?) for them both. Yet, it came across as genuine under the circumstances and taking their pasts into account, and built to an ending that definitely felt right. That ending, which, btw, I LOVED, was quite intensely emotional, on a number of levels, in a way that I wasn’t necessarily expecting from the rest of the story. But like I said, it felt right. (Side note – there are some reviews that said there wasn’t enough lesbian in this “lesbian necromancers in space” novel – and while I do think the marketing team played that up a bit more than we actually get, in comparison with the space and necromancy aspects, I definitely felt a number of legitimate lesbian connections throughout and I would argue that this novel was, on the whole, not meant to ever be a romance, in the traditional sense, within the setting and circumstances the author created. So, for my part, I wouldn’t have been against something more explicit showing up, but I also don’t feel let down by what I got, within the context we were given.) <br /><br />At this time, I’d like to take a moment to say that I deeply appreciate Muir’s willingness to go full in on character deaths (to a wonderfully violent/gory extreme) from beginning to end. Again, I don’t think I’m spoiling anything to say that there were a number of deaths (many, many deaths), and that not a single one was easy or clean. But it was also the perfect sci-fi necromantic type of violence and grittiness, so get ready for that and enjoy it! <br /><br />A darkly hilarious, phenomenally gruesome, creative and wonderfully ghastly necromantic sci-fi adventure. I loved it from start to finish and am so excited to pick this story back up with Harrow the Ninth. <br /><br />“‘A head start,’ said her necromancer, ‘is the only advantage one can claim by choice.’”<br /><br />“Things were happening too much.”"

The book, as it turns out, is just as fantastic. <br /><br />I’ll spare you from the plot rehash, but just know that if you’re looking for a ton of snark, bad*ss fight scenes, and some science mixed in with your magic, then you’ve come to the right place! <br /><br />To those who DNFed or whined about unanswered questions, you’re looking way too deep into it. Ever hear of suspension of disbelief? It’s sci-fi. That’s all you need to know. I get it that the tone is not for everyone, and that’s fine. You gotta be in the mood sometimes. Heck, I’ve DNFed books for less. But I happen to be a fan of crass humor and a snarky narrating voice and I ate up every word. As a writer, I’m jealous of it. It’s refreshing compared to all of the quirked eyebrows and smirks and coy, vomit-inducing BS that is typically rampant in today’s fantasy. Sometimes a well-placed cuss word shows all the intelligence in the world. <br /><br />I will say that the narrative does get info-dumpy in places, but only with the setting. How else would you describe all of the Crichton-esque science labs, though? With lots of descriptors, duh. Anything concerning the actual characters and their dialogue was perfect. <br /><br />Aside from the snark, my favorite was the slow burn relationship between Gideon and Harrow. It was natural, with realistic developments instead of “I hate you so much—aaand now we’re totally besties.” A total testament to the author for carrying the character development steady through 400+ pages. <br /><br />I also enjoyed the fact that there are indeed lesbian necromancers (technically one’s a cavalier) and yet there isn’t any gratuitous sex or even so much as a wistful canoodle. (Not gonna lie tho, my queer heart wanted some.) I just appreciate the fact that love/sex wasn’t necessary for the story to develop just *because* they were lesbians. Feel me? <br /><br />So, if you’re ready for a grand fantasy romp fit with sword fighting, several murder mysteries, a heap of science and a giant avalanche of magic, a sh*t ton of bones, and a whole lot of sass, then this book is for you. But Gideon… she is mine. &lt;3"

As long as it gets her out of the Ninth House, she’s fine with it.<br /><br />After being abandoned as a baby and forced to grow up in an osseous, over-glorified tomb of a home with only unfriendly and decrepit company, Gideon has had about enough.<br /><br />Gideon doesn’t know where home is but it can’t be this.<br /><br />Though, any escape attempt faces the issue of Harrowhark Nonagesimus—Reverend Daughter and sole heir of the Ninth House. She’s a bone with extraordinaire—and a colossal b*tch, if you ask Gideon.<br /><br />The only companion her age, they’ve grown up together in this desolate wasteland.<br /><br />When a missive comes from the Empire requesting all nine Houses send representative necromancers and their cavaliers for a test of vast import, Harrow makes it very clear that Gideon is going with her as her cavalier whether she likes it or not.<br /><br />Only after Gideon has assisted Harrow in completing whatever trials await them so that she can succeed in becoming whatever the Empire requires, will Harrow set Gideon free.<br /><br />Gideon begrudgingly agrees to go.<br /><br />But, great power usually requires great sacrifice. Will these two seeming enemies be able to foot the cost?<br /><br />Ahhhhh this a super cool, spooky, and kick*ss lesbian sci-fi-o-rama!<br /><br />I really like this one a lot!<br /><br />As I like to confess, I’m not a big fan of science fiction. It’s not really my scene. But, make it goth and add in some pretty grizzly necromancer magic—with a dash of queer, doomed-by-the-narrative romance???? You’ve got me there.<br /><br />This is devastatingly good storytelling. I ADORE how the author so seamlessly blends so many things that shouldn’t work together—sci-fi tropes, trad goth imagery, contemporary slang, etc.—and makes them somehow work even better than they usually do? It’s dope.<br /><br />This whole story is dope. Tragic, yes. But, also, so sick.<br /><br />Definitely recommend for all my readers out there who don’t usually go for science fiction stories—for all the usual issues with the genre. This series is definitely subversive, unique, and a real fun ride from start to finish~"

Instead I got a revision of \"And Then There Were None\"<br /><br />Earth is in space, so then every novel that takes place on Earth is a sci-fi. Going to another planet is no different then going to another country to study. There is no point that they can travel between planets, what I can tell, it all take place in a gothic palace. Call it what it is, a dark academia murder mystery with magic.<br /><br />I didn't like the writing style, scenes would drag so long because of paragraphs after paragraphs of descriptions. Lets not focus on side characters' personality, describe one character as gold and other character as pale and that is their personality. This is more of a problem for the side characters from other Houses. The author can write side characters showing attitude through their actions. Placement and Camilla personalities left an impression. Abigail and Magnus, when found dead, I was like \"who?\" <br /><br />Gideon and Harrow do not have the same problem. I learn that Gideon is the warm, caring, doesn't take things serious but knows when she should. I do wish they display more of her skills as a swordswomen, showing why she is a genius versus everyone saying she is a genius. Show don't tell. Harrow is the opposite. Cold, isolated, stubborn and intelligent. Together, I love their bickering and rants but they learn to work together. One would think they are bound to be enemies to lovers. WRONG. I read the spoilers. Don't expect romance. Front cover states there's lesbians, market it that it has representation, show some flirting and call it a day.<br /><br />There was so much potential but it was all limited to one space. I wanted to know more about their beliefs. Why were the last lines of Teacher's prayers completely opposite to Harrow's when she prays. We are not going to explore that Harrow is controlling her parents dead bodies for years without anybody learning about it? That could have been a great reveal.<br /><br />Overall, interesting concepts, poor executions. "

      "review": "I adored this book. Gideon was an instant kindred spirit, despite the fact that we outwardly share little in common. I love her irreverrant sense of humor that carries on in a vicious inner monologue, but rarely gets spoken aloud. <br />Gideon has grown up in near-total social isolation from mysterious origins. The adults, all far older than she is, have neither understanding nor attention for her. The one exception is a single warrior, whose interest and occasional furtive crumbs of kindness stand out in contrast. Of course, Gideon has thrown everything she is into becoming the best swordsperson she could possibly become, and plans to escape and join the military as early as possible. <br />The only other young person in her whole community is the Reverend Daughter, and they have grown up together in a fierce, furious, and f*d-up version of sibling rivalry that's mostly mutual enmity. There's even more baggage there than it first seems, and Gideon lets us in on her own memories and secrets, despite the omnicient-ish narration, only slowly and guardedly, as we might expect if we had tried to befriend her, prickly thing that she is. <br />At this point, I'd like to take issue with the cover blurb of \"lesbian necromancers in space.\" It gives a wrong impression, although this seems more like a way to weed out people who will hate the book than attract those who will love it. I read the book despite this quote, not because of it. This book is far from juvenile or sensationalist. Gideon is clearly queer, but the storyline doesn't revolve around her orientation. And she's not the necromancer, who didn't give us enough to go on to draw conclusions about orientation there. Harrow's and Gideon's relationship is not a sexual one, but has more of a familial feel to me. They spend only a page or two in a spaceship, but the action and memories all happen between two planets. No offense to the author of the quote, but the sooner they take that thing off the cover and bury it in a list of more representative blurbs, the better. <br />The setting is a civilisation that is clearly in decline, with a wide mix of mostly old very high tech and quite primitive conditions. The world-building feels extensive, but Gideon is neither experienced nor academic, so we pick up only snatches and whisps as we discover details with her. There's plenty of ambience, and plenty to intrigue the cerebral but Gideon is not inclined to ruminate, being a woman of action (with snarky inner commentary), and I am happy not to be spoon-fed. Harrow IS a more cerebral character, and I expect the sequel to spend a little more time on the background. For the nerdy, there are some lovely appendices to flesh things out from a historical perspective at the end, and some linguistic fun with names as well. We do have occasional pop-culture references that put a bit of strain on our suspension of disbelief coming from Gideon, but they are so utterly in-character for Gideon I'm always glad to see them anyway. I decided her comic book habit is probably the source of these. <br />The characters have satisfying development, there's plenty of mystery and terror, and lots and lots of suspicion and motives to unravel in addition to the peripheral magic theory. But central to the book and it's greatest strength is the complicated relationship between Gideon and Harrow and the way it changes as events move forward and the past is addressed.<br />Not to be missed."

However, there are many mysteries that are only revealed at the end, so sometimes discussion might be hard if you are stopping every few chapters to discuss. This is my second time reading Gideon, and I loved it even more. This series is highly rewarding if you read all the books that are out so far. I'm a sucker for a story where a loveable dope has to deal with some horror story level stuff. Alecto should be coming out sometime in 2024. <br /><br /><br />Genre: Science Fiction, High Fantasy <br /><br />Tropes: Not Like other girls, Enemies to Lovers, Power has a price, Magic, Coming of Age, Everyone has a motive<br /><br />Things I liked: This book and series, in general, do a really good job of making you care really deeply about the characters. Which sometimes can make for really heartwarming or heartbreaking scenes. <br /><br />Things I disliked: This book has a lot of queer representation, but very little of the story has any of the characters being romantically involved. While I know its not a romance novel, I when I read it the first time I was told there would be lesbians so I was kinda hoping they would be making out at least. <br /><br />Audiobook or Physical? Audiobook is a must for Gideon! Moira Quirk does an amazing job. She has so many voices, both male and female, that are unique and amazing! <br /><br />Extras: Gideon's POV, if you read Homestuck when you were younger, this might seem familiar"

      "review": "4/5 stars. no spoilers.<br /><br />Yeah I had a great time reading this. <br /><br />The first half is quite slow and there are a lot of characters that get introduced at once but as soon as the first death happens the plot kicks into high gear and it's a fun time. I enjoy the magic system in this world, I think it's such a cool way to think of necromancy as not just bones but also having different kinds of necromancy specializations and approaches like ofc bone but also tissue and spirit. I think the different trials are such an interesting way and I wish we got to see more of them than we actually did, but that's the nerd in me wanting to see more about how this magic works. <br /><br />Gideon isn't the kind of MC that I usually like, but she grew on me. I prefer a character that has a clear goal and is actively driving the plot along but Gideon is clearly coerced into participating and Harrow is the one driving the plot forward which is why at the beginning I was a little frustrated with this story not being told by Harrow's POV. Now I know this book <i>needed</i> to be written in Gideon's POV for multiple different reasons – some plot related, some not – but I also think it was a smart move to have Gideon be the narrator because of her humor. Gideon's humor reminds me of 2016 – not with pop culture references obviously since this is a SFF, but it's like the comedic timing and set up has a distinctly 2016 vibe. It may also just be that the humor is juvenile at points, which makes sense because Gideon is like 18 during the events of this book and with the dynamic between her and Harrow it's very clear that yes they've been negging each other since infancy. I started appreciating Gideon's voice more when I kept seeing just how serious and gothic and weird (positive) the setting and plot was, which made her inclusion of \"-and in walked this asshole\" feel like a much-needed reprieve.<br /><br />This book is marketed as lesbian necromancers in space, which yes is an apt description, but if you're looking for a romance and some women smooching that's not what you're going to get. Like yes these are obviously lesbians, and the relationship between Gideon and Harrow really is the core of this book, but I personally wouldn't characterize it as a romantic relationship. The author <i>could have</i> written a more explicitly romantic relationship, but frankly I don't think it would have actually been a good dynamic and I'm glad it didn't go that route. As a lesbian I will always desire more sapphic romance in media and especially in SFF, but given everything this book is trying to do and the path I think this series is going towards (I have only read this first book and the second book in this series) the relationship simply would not have had room to breathe and it would have fallen flat on its ass. Though it isn't a perfectly executed dynamic – the start of their switch from enemies to negging to friendship could've been done just a little better – I respect the dynamic that did get written and I think it adds the best possible emotional weight to their relationship and the events in this series. Further, it's made me think about how I want \"lesbians and wlw in SFF\" to not just be delegated to romantic relationships or romantasy, but to also include this kind of dynamic as well. Basically, I don't want to treat lesbian media as synonymous with romance media. I like this book and I liked book 2, I'll be picking up book 3 soon."

Specifically the relationship between the cavaliers and their necromancers. <br /><br />I was nervous about the direction of Harrow and Gideon’s relationship. After all, how can friendship or even romance develop when one party holds a ridiculous amount of power over the other? But by going to Canaan House, where Harrow is not AS revered as she is on the Ninth, and has to solve puzzles and challenges by her own merits, we discover how much she truly needs Gideon. In fact, we discover how much Harrow has ALWAYS needed Gideon. <br /><br />And while their relationship was still pretty toxic, I ask what sapphic among us has not experienced a toxic, codependent, queer-coded friendship? I rest my case 😭 However, as a person of several marginalized identities, I definitely had to divorce myself from that aspect a little, but overall, I thought it was pretty well done. <br /><br />I also love the symbolism behind Canaan House. In the Bible, Canaan was cursed for a horrific, defiling acts against God, but then the land being a promise of milk and honey? Like, I love the foreshadowing that this promise of power has a dark secret underneath. Yeah, the foreshadowing ate DOWN in this book. <br /><br />I definitely think the audience seeing everything from Gideon’s eyes helped with the foreshadowing aspect too. From snippets of conversations, to aspects of the world that Gideon (and by extension us) just didn’t know, provided such a real experience reading it. <br /><br />I could go on about this book, but I’ll stop myself here. This book was so good, and I already ordered the next installment from the library"

      "review": "This book really left a lot to be desired for me and ultimately I'm disappointed in it, deeply for the romance between the two main characters, Harrow and Gideon. <br /><br />Their introduction begins with how much they cannot stand each other, they seethe at the sight of each other and Harrowhawk holds a position of power over Gideons life, in a way she OWNS Gideon. Gideon desires nothing more than to live her own life and is constantly tormented by a controlling Harrow who even goes as far as to purposefully crush Gideons hopes in front of her eyes just to relish in her pain. You learn later that Harrow does these things because shes mad at herself, and taking it out on Gideon as a way to pin the blame on anyone but her— lovely grounds for a relationship after one measly conversation about it, right?? (sarcasm, that shit sucked)<br /><br />These women find themselves in a situation in which they must rely on each other, and truthfully, that barely feels consequential. It doesn't make entire sense to me why Gideon NEEDED Harrow alive with the information she had at the time other than a half assed commitment to protect her. Harrow becomes lost and Gideon delightfully ruminates on how she would love for Harrow to die or be dead, would even make friendship bracelets with her murderer, but then the moment shes informed that Harrow is in trouble shes doubling over to save her— theres no real reason to explain her change of heart and the author doesn't really dive into Gideon's reasonings for softening to Harrow... It just.. kinda happens.<br /><br />And thats really how the rest of it plays out between them. Things just sort of happen? I was really looking forward to enjoying a deep sapphic romance, and instead what I received was an oppressor crying to her oppressed about how she knows she was awful and her oppressed forgiving her just because shes shown a touch of a soft side. There's not enough give and take between these two to really feel like Harrow deserves Gideon's forgiveness or her ultimate sacrifice, and from the perspective of a woman who comes<br />from an oppressed minority— this book sort of felt like a slap in the face regarding its main romance (Also to mention it's idk if its really stated if ANY OF the 10+ characters in this story are BIPOC lol)<br /><br />On top of that, this book places a lot of side characters amongst its two main ones— and nearly all of them are identical. The author really enjoys this edgy, quippy dialogue take and almost ALL of the characters are just straight up.... ill mannered and mean? Snarky, pissy, always trying to one up another in dialogue, its boring. It isn't until people start dying that actual personalities start to solidify themselves, and it makes it seem as though these other side characters were inconsequential. <br /><br />The best thing this book had going for it was the authors ability to pull you along through the mystery that develops, and while it was predictable at points it did not necessary mean that reveals were not satisfying. It was only through this and one side characters mystery was I able to pull myself through this novel.<br /><br />Overall, this book tripped over itself in many ways. Character development was poor, the world building was there but could have been executed better in its explanations, and lastly it relied way too deeply in the idea of its satirical one liners. I left this book feeling bad for Gideon, an oppressed woman who only desired to live her life, thrust into a situation she didn't ask for, and then forced into an unconvincing care to a woman who manipulated and hurt her, just to die for her and disappear— it's all prosed so heroically, as if she really wanted to do it and felt so moved in her soul— but no, it just left me with a sigh of disappointment instead.

But in reading other reviews, I'm thankfully not the only one who felt that way. <br /><br />It begins in media res, but you have no idea what is going on. Gideon is trying to escape this planet. Why? Who knows. It seems very gothic and there are skeletons but nothing is clear. It's like trying to see something through a fog. Finally the main plot begins. Gideon is to act as a cavalier (fighter) protecting Harrow, a necromancer in her quest to become a lyctor. They go to another planet to do this. The process to become a lyctor is unclear. Fourteen other characters are introduced. It's impossible to keep them all straight. About halfway through, the plot picks up. There's a mystery to be solved. You start to become attached to the characters. The magic system is somewhat explained. I did enjoy parts of this book a lot. There's kind of a discordance between the zingy, modern, slangy dialogue and the elaborate descriptions, often with archaic vocabulary. This irritated me at first, but it grew on me, as did Gideon's personality. <br /><br />This book is promoted as being about lesbian necromancers in space. Let me be clear. The main character expresses attraction to women but there is NO romance, NO sex, not even so much as a kiss. So if you're looking for lesbian representation where this status is just mentioned in passing and has nothing to do with the plot, this book is great, but if you are looking for sapphic romance, this isn't it. Also yes they travel between planets on a spaceship, but that kind of happens behind the scenes and being in space is just not very important. This is basically gothic/dark fantasy with some sci fi elements. <br /><br />I applaud the author for creating such an elaborate, original world. There's clearly a lot of worldbuilding behind the scenes that has yet to be explained even at the end of the book. We are only seeing a small portion of a vast space empire with 9 different planets and cultures. I'm sure more will be unfurled in the other novels in the series. But I'm very torn on whether I will continue reading because I found the book frustrating at times even though I ended up enjoying it. "

The dialogue throughout is strange and in the hardback the formatting is odd and can be a little too much. <br /><br />Gideon is not anything like I first thought it would be based on the cover. For one I thought Gideon was a boy. She isn’t, she is a sword wielding woman, stuck on a dying planet/territory called the Ninth that has more dead things running around at the will of one person that it has living. Gideon has tried 87 various ways to escape this dead planet only to be thwarted at every go, mostly by her nemesis Harrow to be stuck on a planet she hates. From the beginning you could see these two could be just a few turns away from turning from enemies into something more. <br /><blockquote>\n  <i>\n    <b> The Lady of the Ninth House stood before the drillshaft, wearing black and sneering. Reverend Daughter Harrowhark Nonagesimus had pretty much cornered the market on wearing black and sneering. It comprised 100 percent of her personality. Gideon marvelled that someone could live in the universe only seventeen years and yet wear black and sneer with such ancient self-assurance.</b>\n  </i>\n</blockquote><br />The Ninth is a land full of secrets and dead and Harrow is keeper to both. But she needs Gideon to be her swordswoman for a trial set by the emperor. If Harrow succeeds in this trial, she will get something special akin to immortality and a way to save the dying Ninth house. If Gideon helps, she is promised freedom.<br /><br />I really wasn’t sure what I was getting into when this was said to be <i>Queer Necromancers in Space</i>. I definitely thought there would be more lesbian like things, but other than the fact Gideon is definitely into girls there isn’t much pushing behind that. She likes the look of girls and thinks a few thoughts along those lines. There is a underlying current of something building between Gideon and Harrow, it could blow up spectacularly at any moment into more. But not much time is spent on that at all. <br /><br />Mostly this is a tale of going to a strange place with hidden catacombs to search for the secrets of the former Lyctors to become one themselves<br /><blockquote>\n  <b>\n    <i> The whole place had the look of a picked-at body. But hot damn! What a beautiful corpse.</i>\n  </b>\n</blockquote><br />It is dangerous as the other eight houses are there also and everyone is competing for keys that will show them the secrets of how to be better necromancers to the point that eternal live becomes yours. It gets messy as Harrow and Gideon are thrown into ever more dangerous situations trying to stay alive, discover who is killing off the competition and learn the secrets for themselves as well.<br /><br />I’m going to give the author some big props for having such a strange idea full of imagery, brutality and death. She did a great job of not doing the expected in this. I didn’t really get some of the motivations of why a few things happened the way they did but I was surprised by so many things especial Gideon and Harrow’s connection in the end.<br /><br />Gideon was easy for me to like. She has a great fun sense of humor that is very out there and I think that listening to the Audiobook for this novel made it better for me. The dialogue is a little twisty at times and the narrator sorted it for me so that I didn’t have to think about it too hard.<br /><blockquote>\n  <b>\n    <i> “My uncle can’t eat with your kind around,” he said. “Please leave.” <br />Gideon had a million questions. Like: Your kind? And: Why do you have such a baby uncle, one the colour of mayonnaise? And: Is “your kind” people who aren’t nephews and who have middle fingers?</i>\n  </b>\n</blockquote><br />For all of it’s inventiveness there is a large chunk of time where nothing is really happening in the story. The worldbuilding could have been flushed out a bit better as well. We are in this really cool story where there is a galactic war happening. But other than there being 9 necromantic houses to the emperor, each with their own way of performing necromancy I don’t know much. There seems like there is so much to explore in this setting and I didn’t get enough info on the characters to really form strong attachments to most of them. Also, some of the deaths still didn’t make sense to me later when the perpetrator was revealed. Since I couldn’t reconcile a few events I have to drop the star rating. Don’t let that discourage you, there are some great, strange wonders throughout the book and the ending literally shocked and amazed me. I will definitely be picking up Harrow when it comes out.<br /><blockquote>\n  <i>\n    <b>“It’s bad enough that we’re stuck in this burnt-out old hovel without me scaring you. Isn’t it fantastically abandoned? Imagine all the ghosts of everyone who must have lived here … worked here … still waiting to be called, if we could figure out how. The Seventh doesn’t do well with ghosts, you know. We offend them. We’re worrisome. The old division between body and spirit. We deal too much with the body … crystallising it in time … trapping it unnaturally. The opposite of your House, don’t you think, Gideon the Ninth? You take empty things and build with them … We press down the hand of a clock, to try to stop it from ticking the last second.”</b>\n  </i>\n</blockquote><br />Truly a unique story."

      "review": "I don’t typically read sci-fi or fantasy books so picking this up after its recommendation was a stretch for my comfort zone. How could I not be sold on the classic pitch, “lesbian necromancers in space”? <br /><br />The novel is narrated by Gideon Nav, a super charismatic and witty lesbian who loves swords, working out, and reading magazines with scandily-clad necromancers. She is an indentured servant to the heir of the House of the Ninth, which is basically a cold, dark planet. The Ninth House’s necromantic specialty is bones (cue a million and one bone puns) and it has a storied, dark and complicated past which resulted in Gideon and Harrowhark Nonagesimus (the heir to the house) being the only two children of their generation to grow up together. They have a relationship which can only be described as somewhere between hate and obsession with one another. <br /><br /><blockquote>“Nonagesimus,” [Gideon] said slowly, “the only job I’d do for you would be if you wanted someone to hold the sword as you fell on it. The only job I’d do for you would be if you wanted your ass kicked so hard, the Locked Tomb opened and a parade came out to sing, ‘Lo! A destructed ass.’ The only job I’d do would be if you wanted me to spot you while you backflipped off the top tier into Drearburh.”<br /><br />“That’s three jobs,” said Harrowhark.</blockquote><br /><br />Gideon wants nothing more than to be set free and to be allowed to leave the planet. She has tried running away countless times without success. Harrow makes Gideon a deal: if she accompanies her to a competition as essentially her bodyguard/fighter or \"cavalier\" then after it’s over, Gideon will be set free. <br /><br />The bulk of the novel takes place during the competition, where we get to learn about the other eight Houses, who have also each sent one representative pair of a necromancer/cavalier pair. We learn about each planet’s personality types, roles and necromantic specialties. There are a lot of characters and complexities which makes it difficult to keep track of who is who, so it’s handy to have a spoiler-free list. <br /><br />A lot of chaos ensues as the novel hovers between fantasy, sci-fi, horror and a little murder mystery as a treat. <br /><br />As time goes on, it becomes clear that Gideon and Harrow need to at least try to work together, but… it’s almost physically painful for them to be nice to each other.<br /><br /><blockquote>“Don't die in a bone. I am your creature, gloom mistress. I serve you with fidelity as big as a mountain, penumbral lady.\"<br /><br />Harrow's eyes flickered open. \"Stop.\"<br /><br />\"I am your sworn sword, night boss.\"<br /><br />\"Fine,\" said Harrow heavily.<br /><br />Gideon's mouth was about to round out the words \"bone empress\" before she realised what had been said.</blockquote><br /><br />This novel (and series) has some very camp moments that reference internet memes or overly-millennial-dialogue but like, (I never thought I would say this) <i>good ones</i> - it pulls them off in a genuinely entertaining way. (I should mention as an aside here that the author of this book has been writing fanfiction from a young age. Some of her Homestuck fanfics are still available online somewhere. I feel like she must have grown up in the same circles of the internet that I frequented in my past, for better or for worse lmao, but she manages to distill that sort of atmosphere in the best way possible as comic relief in her books.) A few examples of these vibes are below.<br /><br /><blockquote>\"While we were developing common sense, she studied the blade.”</blockquote><br /><br />and,<br /><br /><blockquote>Gideon was experiencing one powerful emotion: being sick of everyone’s shit.”</blockquote><br /><br />and...<br /><br /><blockquote>He had the eyes of a very beautiful person, trapped in resting bitch face.</blockquote><br /><br />There is so much to say about this book. It’s not a romance, or a YA (Young Adult) novel. It has some pretty dark and tragic scenes. It’s dense book with a lot going on that doesn’t fully make sense until the final quarter of the book. Since the novel is told from Gideon's POV and Gideon is left in the dark about a <i>lot</i> of stuff, this makes sense. It’s the type of book that benefits from multiple re-reads, or at least watching some (spoiler-free) video essays or reading some forum threads afterward.<br /><br />This is only the first book in a series of four. After finishing, I immediately picked up the next book <i>Harrow the Ninth</i> which I proceeded to love about a thousand times more if that’s even possible. <br /><br />I enjoy a lot of books, but this one has been the most <i>fun</i> I’ve had reading in a long time. <br /><br /><blockquote>\"Nav, show them what the Ninth House does.\" <br /><br />Gideon lifted her sword... \"We do bones, motherfucker.\"</blockquote>"

Gideon the main character is very obviously clear but with that tag line front and center tbh I expected a romance and I can’t rate a book based off my personal wrong expectations but oh well I do what I want. Also Gideon isn’t a necromancer in this book so lesbian necromancers singular, maybe a bisexual one idk what was goin on w that dulcinea fake. Harrow also was mentioned once in the entire book that she was queer in a scene where she talked about falling in love with a lady who died ten thousand years ago like how bizzare? And ur telling me harrow and Gideon were the only two ppl in their generation on their boring planet and they’re both gay but they never banged? Don’t belive it. Besides that the world building was a little weak and I thought the development of their relationship wasn’t fleshed out enough. Like they hate each other for no reason for the whole book and the reveal was kinda a weak reason and was resolved like four pages later and suddenly they’re best friends and probably in love? Nah. I saw lesbian necromancers and that they hated each other and I was like ooh slow burn but I didn’t expect it to be so fucking slow to the point Gideon has to kill herself and join bodies w Harrow to be w her. Whatever I’m rambling it’s j it would’ve been better if they banged."

      "review": "Man I dunno that kind of just never got off the ground. just felt like a slog and uninteresting and all the mysteries weren't set up enough and were resolved in baffling ways. lots of high fantasy melodrama that gets punctured by deeply unfunny snarky remarks. An ending which is a really long unfollowable action sequence. The lesbianess of it was barely developed and felt unearned and laughable and also just sucked in terms of weird power dynamics - like it felt like I was reading references to fanfiction tropes as if briefly running a checklist could substitute for actual emotional development. <br /><br />This just really did not land for me at all and also the length of it really made its flaws even worse. Oh well.<br /><br />The sort of central relationship of the book is between Harrow and Gideon but it's really badly developed. It opens with Gideon being dead set on leaving the planet forever due partly to Harrow's years of abuse. This desire is clearly sincere and she shows no connection to Harrow. And then when she gets tricked into being tied to Harrow for a mission for the emperor, Harrow specifically avoids her for a long period of the book. And then things develop in a way that you can predict based on genre of book but makes no sense within story. <input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"spoiler__control\" aria-label=\"The following text has been marked spoiler. Toggle checkbox to reveal or hide.\" onchange=\"this.labels[0].setAttribute('aria-hidden', !this.checked);\" id=\"d12784de-1183-4853-9c9e-eaab716ba0db\" /><label aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"spoiler\" for=\"d12784de-1183-4853-9c9e-eaab716ba0db\">So Gideon suddenly starts showing care for Harrow even when Harrow isn't caring for her and never has done. Even when it's told from Gideon's thought process PoV it's not explained why she's suddenly doing this. Gideon puts herself into dangerous situations to rescue Harrow despite Harrow deliberately avoiding her and preventing her from actually supporting her even as a duty thing. When Harrow finally decides to make use of Gideon and wants her to do dangerous and/or autonomy reducing things, Gideon just jumps straight into it. Things like *having Harrow in her mind*. Going through excruciating agonising pain where her life energy is ripped out of her. She suddenly starts trusting Harrow for no reason without even trying to find another way. There's some vague stuff about it possibly being a prelude to her escaping but also she doesn't believe Harrow would actually let her. Theres minimal dealing with the emotional issues it's just like. Weird training montage. Then finally you get a dramatic scene where some mysteries are explained and Gideon just completely forgives Harrow for years and years of abuse. And then at the end of the book Gideon sacrifices herself for Harrow. It just feels completely and utterly unearned. There's very little development, it's just like. Ok you abused me for my entire life and all I've ever wanted to do is escape from your orbit but now we're inseparable soulmates. And then the book doesn't even give you any satisfaction from this cause Gideon just kills herself soon after. It feels really uncomfortable and weird but it feels like it's doing fanfic where I should be like oh this is so cool! Enemies to lovers! I recognise that! It's lame. </label><br /><br />The massive palace most of the book is set in is set up to be filled with mysteries but in the end tons of the mystery is short circuited or never explained and it feels like a lot of the book was a shaggy dog story <input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"spoiler__control\" aria-label=\"The following text has been marked spoiler. Toggle checkbox to reveal or hide.\" onchange=\"this.labels[0].setAttribute('aria-hidden', !this.checked);\" id=\"cebb6782-56ba-487d-b840-79e11135f80e\" /><label aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"spoiler\" for=\"cebb6782-56ba-487d-b840-79e11135f80e\">there's occasional things about the planet having insane amounts of death on it and the palace being filled with spirits who could do dodgy things and possess you because of the incredible amount of necromantic experimentation that went on there. This is used a couple of times to build up tension and then it eventually happens in the end and it's just \"this 1 guy becomes a monster for a page before getting stabbed\". There's lots of implications about the history and I actually love the \"a world of magic on top of ancient science\" vibe of the facility but it never gets delved into. There are mysterious caretakers of the facility who do things like prevent them communicating and destroying the shuttles that brought them there - barely anyone seems bothered by this. The caretakers turn out to have an incredible history but we only find that out after they die. And nothing gets explained! We learn next to nothing about the palace. Nothing about it makes sense. The whole puzzle aspect of learning through trials is completely short circuited at the end when it's just like \"oh yeah I worked out to become really powerful you just stab someone you know really well. It was obvious I didn't need to do any of the puzzles\" It just sucks.</label><br /><br />As well as the mysteries of the world there's also a sort of detective mystery that starts getting going part way through. And in the end you uncover the villain... And it's so stupid!!! <input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"spoiler__control\" aria-label=\"The following text has been marked spoiler. Toggle checkbox to reveal or hide.\" onchange=\"this.labels[0].setAttribute('aria-hidden', !this.checked);\" id=\"45f655d0-636a-464d-9899-e4f4d2fe2879\" /><label aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"spoiler\" for=\"45f655d0-636a-464d-9899-e4f4d2fe2879\">So the real villain was an extremely powerful necromancer who wanted to kill everyone to attract the attention of the god emperor and did this by disguising herself as someone who had cancer and was about to die. Her doing that made her also have cancer??? Which is essential to the ending??? In the ending she's shown to have incredible powers such that even with her cancer keeping her in near death it still needs 1 guy sacrificing himself in the exact right way, 2 special swords people and 2 of the same category of incredibly powerful necromancer to defeat her. Shes also shown to be able to kill people completely remotely. So why didn't she just do that? The entire book feels like a waste of time because she doesn't bother killing people in a normal amount of time when she could easily do it at any time and pick people off one by one and even if she got discovered they would all die together if they hadn't discovered the ritual yet. Instead she waits for ages so that people can finally kill her. Convenient, but a waste of my time</label><br /><br />Just... So much of this made no sense. And to be honest it's kind of misleading that people are like \"oh it's gay\" like it's such a shit portrayal of ANY human relationship and it's barely there and also unsurprisingly it's another trope <input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"spoiler__control\" aria-label=\"The following text has been marked spoiler. Toggle checkbox to reveal or hide.\" onchange=\"this.labels[0].setAttribute('aria-hidden', !this.checked);\" id=\"1b5f732d-275d-482b-a84a-b6b61921968a\" /><label aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"spoiler\" for=\"1b5f732d-275d-482b-a84a-b6b61921968a\">tragic lesbians! Of course one of them had to die! Of course it had to be the one in a subordinate social role</label><br /><br />Also one of the 5 star reviews is topped with the quote \"one flesh, one end, bitch\" which in the book made me burst out laughing because it wasn't funny but came at the end of THE melodramatic and emotional scene in the book and just completely punctured any emotion the author was trying to build up. The sort of YA narrator/Buffy dialogue stuff really did not work on any level for me."

      "review": "I've read Gideon twice now, first in 2021 and second time a couple of months ago, taking turns reading it aloud with my girlfriend.<br /><br />Gideon and it's sequel have been my favourite books of 2021 and 2022 respectively. Admittedly, it took me a couple tries to get past the first chapter on my first read through - merging together the imagery of space ships and skeletons took a little while in my brain. Still, I decided that the whole concept of the story and world would not have been be this specific if the author didn't have something to offer regarding it, and for that I was willing to suspend my disbelief.<br /><br />What I really appreciated about Gideon is the way it is told through the perspective of someone growing up in a dark wet barrel, and therefore the audience is also awarded only as much information as what Gideon has. A lot of it you have to extrapolate from the scenes, the dialogue and the way characters act, which I personally don't mind at all as I love analyzing what I read. <br /><br />Interestingly I've seen a couple of people comment how the world building is weird or inconsistent, in that for example spaceships exist but at the same time Gideon doesn't know what a sink or a bath is. To that I have to say that is the essence of showing and not telling; letting the audience make their own conclusions from the information in front of them. What could that mean? I think the absurdity of Gideon's reaction is entirely the point: I think you're meant to be like \"why on earth would they not have showers on the Ninth House!\" and the answer is because showers are nice and the Ninth house grinds niceness into dust under it's bony heel. They have sonic cleaners that work just as well; on the Ninth house there is no luxury or comfort to be taken in living. Gideon experiencing things considered normal for the first time at Canaan House is just a highlight of how decrepit things were where she came from and how strange enjoyment of life's simple pleasures is to her.<br /><br />To me the deepness of the world-building didn't necessarily come from huge lore drops or intimately knowing the inner workings of the society or the different houses. Rather I found it engaging how all of the houses had a different dynamic with each other, had pre-held beliefs of what the necromancers or types of necromancy were like, and reacted to other characters accordingly. Accusing the Ninth house of being weirdo shadow cultists in an empire that is essentially completely made out of weirdo shadow cultists was gold, haha. <br /><br />There's definitely a very conscious tongue-in-cheek tone to the book. What made it stand out to me against other books with similar humor was how the author seemed 100% purposeful in the use of awfulness. I don't know how to word this other than that the characters are all fucking embarrassing, and that is exactly how it's meant to be. Harrow and every single other necromancer take themselves with utmost seriousness, and you as the reader are awarded the reality of just how cringe they are and how unaware they are of their own cringeness. To give an example, in another space opera I just finished, Winter's Orbit (which in it's blurb is recommended to fans of Gideon! respectfully disagreed.), most of the characters have a tone of dry wit and snazzy remarks as their go-to style of conversation. The difference to Gideon is that it takes it's own humor seriously, the jokes being framed as something that should endear readers to the characters. In Gideon, I very much felt that the endearment came from the fact that the jokes are purposefully god-awful to be in contrast with the kind of image the characters hold of themselves. They are cringe and the author knows it, and only by accepting that cringeness can you find the coolness in them. Though, I have to say that I do have particular a fondness for characters who are utterly pathetic and embarrassing and would not realize it even if it hit them in the face with a brick.<br /><br />If there was something I would criticize about this book it would probably be the sort-of-false-advertising about the lesbians in space. This book is definitely not a romance, though the development of not necessarily healthy devotion that transcends life and death is there, and honestly, I think I prefer it that way. There is something much more intriguing in that nameless emotion for me. Not to mention, Harrow and Gideon are both so incredibly fucked up by their pasts that them transitioning to anything resembling a normal stable relationship or romance from their current state would feel incredibly jarring and frankly, out of character for both of them.<br /><br />I think there is also some critique to be made against how this book handles being the subject of abuse. I think more could've been done to keep from being so \"Abuser thinks you are special after all\" in Gideon and Harrow's case, and I was missing some of that justified anger being unleashed on Harrow. I don't know, I was so compelled by the other elements of the book that I was willing to give it a pass, but at the back of my mind I am still hoping it is returned to in the coming installations.<br /><br />All in all, I find this book surprised me at many points, and let my imagination run wild with the implications of the world we got. Truly felt like something to sink my teeth into. :)"

      "review": "I can’t lie, I didn’t want to read this book. Someone I used to be friends with adored this book and I really don’t like that person. I am however unable to deny that this book is fantastic. I am making my boyfriend reading. <br /><br />I definitely understand why some people are put off. I can see how it could be perceived as dense, and Gideon’s ironic millennial humor was kinda annoying for the first 50 pages. The book also doesn’t hold your hand that much through the plot and world building. I think that is partly because the only pov we get is Gideons, who is 1. Not as smart as the people she is surrounded by in this book, 2. Socially and culturally cut off from basically everyone on the ninth, and 3. Generally pretty uninterested with necromancy and really anything that isn’t related to food, fighting, and porn. So I think the lack of context we are given makes a lot of sense given that. <br /><br />Despite being a complex book with a lot of characters, deaths, and really confusing setting and plot, but it doesn’t do something that I dislike in books, it doesn’t act smarter than it is(ready player one is an example even though I liked it). This book knows what it is and acts like it. Gideons cringy jokes are treated as cringy and annoying by other characters, and all of the characters are fleshed out with unique personalities and motivations. I am also a beginner in the sci-fi genre but I found this world really unique, it started out feeling like a typical fantasy kinda setting I am used to but then she mentions porn magazines and hops in a spaceship?! My only other sci-fi experience was the wonder saga which is just a completely different kind genre. Anyways I love this, I wish there was more romance present but then again something I hate about books that have come out in the last couple years is how heavy the romance is and it is kinda refreshing to read something trying to emulate the perfect “spice level” or an acotar copycat. <br /><br />Even though it is queer and does have space travel kinda sci fi, you will likely be very disappointed if these are the only reasons you show up. The queerness is quintessential to Gideons character but it does not take up a lot of page space. And most of the moon is in one location.<br /><br />(It feels so weird to be genuinely fangirling like a 13 year old while 21)"

      "review": "An absolutely refreshing read. Gideon is a sassy, sarcastic narrator with balls of steel and Harrow is a perfect counterpart and companion to her character. Muir's descriptions are amazingly vivid and the straightforward tone and sarcasm littered throughout don't take away from setting the scene. She's done a great job at keeping Gideon (and all the characters, really) sassy badasses without devolving into sounding whiny or self-centered. The characters manage to transition seamlessly from banter to serious conversations, to banter again, and each one is so unique and quirky that it isn't too hard to keep track of who belongs to which house. And they have surprisingly really wholesome interactions at times and I really loved the comradery and way they interacted as things changed in the plot. <br /><br />Also, I LOVED this necromantic world and its completely different systems and rules. It is so cool?!?!?! And also, ha, \"thanergy\" like Thanatos, the god of death in Greek mythology. I love it. This isn't a straight translation from our world into Gideon's at all, but the way everything is introduced is done so well that it's no struggle to keep up and understand what's going on, even with the necromantic academic jargon that comes up sometimes. It's a super cool concept and fleshed out well.<br /><br />And I appreciated so much the casual queer representation, like Gideon's casual porn with necromantically unlikely cleavage, or her taking a second glance at another attractive character. I like that there wasn't an emphasized romance going on here, but we also aren't ignoring that yes, she's attracted to women, and yes, she has eyes and a heart.<br /><br />All in all, an amazing read, well written and conceptualized, that doesn't take itself too seriously but does a great job transporting you to a whole different world.

      "review": "I’m going to be honest with you: I picked this book up because it has been hyped all over the internet, the characters are queer and the cover looks amazingly creepy. If there’s ‘space’ in the description of the book it usually never makes it onto my tbr-pile. However, it has become some people’s favorite book and I just wanted to know why.<br /><br />This book is being marketed as ‘lesbian necromancers in space’. While the characters are definitely queer; if you are looking for sapphic romance then you will be disappointed. I’m just warning you beforehand. Gideon the Ninth is definitely sci-fi and fantasy (more fantasy than sci-fi) but it’s also horror. This book gets creepy and dark. <b>Trigger warnings</b> for: blood, gore, violence, death, suicide, death of a parent, cancer, mass murder<br /><br />Gideon the Ninth was hard to get into for me. It took me nearly a 100 pages to really fall into the story and start enjoying what I read. So here’s my advice: if this feels like a whole lot of bollocks then just keep reading. Especially chapter 8. Read chapter 8 and then decide if it’s worth your time or not. The book gets waaay more interesting after that chapter. <br /><br /><br />I’ll get more into detail now (no spoilers, don’t worry!).<br /><br />First off: the characters. I thought the characters all had distinct personalities. I am forever thankful for the glossary because the names confused me for probably half the book. It’s hard to figure out who’s who when there’s a big cast and they all have names I can barely pronounce. As for the main characters I can only say that I absolutely loved them by the end of the book. <br /><br />The atmosphere was dark and mysterious and very very eerie at times. As I said I consider Gideon the Ninth as a horror novel so prepare to be freaked out. Thank god Gideon was so witty and funny or this book would have gotten way too serious and therefore way too scary for my tastes. The humor was a welcome break from the death, let’s keep it at that. <br /><br />The plot is what confused me so much in the beginning and especially when I listened to the audiobook. I’d say the plot becomes more clear at the 80 page mark. That’s when I started to understand what was happening and where this was going. Then around half-way through things start to heat up because people are suddenly being murdered and we’re all trying to figure out whodunit.<br /><br />When it comes to logic that’s where the book lost me a couple of times. Either I didn’t grasp the rules of necromancy or they weren’t explained very well. I often didn’t know what the hell was going on and how I was supposed to picture it in my head. Which leads me to the topic of worldbuilding. The worldbuilding was seriously lacking in Gideon the Ninth. This book is set in space and all we know is that there are 9 planets. We don’t know if this is an alternate universe or a far-off future (I would think the latter since there’s a Mean Girls reference). What differentiates these 9 planets from each other and what’s their history? Are there more than 9 planets out there? What do these planets look like? <br /><br />In conclusion: I never thought I would like this book but here we are… The plot and the characters made up for the lack of worldbuilding. I can’t wait to read the sequel and hopefully get some answers. If you’re intimidated to pick it up then I understand but just give it a go. Gideon the Ninth is definitely not for everyone but I recommend checking it out nonetheless. <br /><br />I used the CAWPILE rating method by Book Roast (Youtube) to rate this book. On the 0-10 rating scale I gave it a 7 which is 4 stars. <br />"

The whole thing is campy as fuck) and initially thought I would hate it within the first couple chapters but somewhere long the way I lost all sense of irony and now I will be making this series my entire personality<br /><br />U should read this if you enjoy:<br /><br />- absolute no-limits worldbuilding and magic systems. This shit was bananas, and so creative in a way that absolutely shouldn’t have worked but .. did. I’ll admit that I was confused about what was going on and the different rules of necromancy for like 80% of this, which I struggled with in the beginning tbh. BUT this kind of vagueness worked extremely well for Gideon’s character, because she really doesn’t give a fuck about any of the science or bone magic shit. So, the reader only really gets what Gideon comprehends (which isn’t much) but I think that works to its advantage because then you can pretty much go crazy with the necromancy and not get too caught up in the mechanics of it<br /><br />-emo goth bone blood edgy bullshit spooky ghost wow<br /><br />- dumbass butch lesbian representation! I rarely ever see masculine lesbians done well in books, and as a main character??? I’m obsessed. Her voice was very distinct and likable and easy to root for, but still complex and three-dimensional<br /><br />- sapphic yearning. Like so much. A ridiculous amount. History will say that Gideon and Harrow were very good friends. Somethin about the estranged childhood friend turned enemy/rival I-hate-you-but-can’t-live-without-you-please-give-me-the-time-of-day codependent idiots who can’t communicate dynamic really scratches an itch in my brain<br /><br />- a plot that mixes mystery, horror, scifi, fantasy, and interpersonal dramatics<br /><br />There are parts of this book that are .. genuinely bad (e.g. the author’s incessant love affair with unnecessary adverbs (like, c’mon, REDLY???), the confusing as hell beginning, the questionably written action scenes, and a .. mean girls reference). But I loved this so much that I’m willing to look past the rough edges and rate it five stars because I’m the worst and I’m gay and I want Gideon and Harrow to kiss on the mouth<br /><br />“I’ve lived my whole wretched life at your mercy, yours alone, and God knows I deserve to die at your hand. You are my only friend. I am undone without you.”"

      "review": "I just finished this audiobook and am sitting in something of a daze - stone cold stunned by the entire experience. This book was imaginative beyond measure, smart, complicated, funny, shocking, devastating and completely mind-blowing. And I am all about it. I would likely never have picked up this book if not for the recommendation of my favorite author and the praise she gave it and narrator Moira Quirk, who was astoundingly good.<br />I cannot believe that this was the author's first novel. How is that even possible?!?<br />This is a book I will have to revisit in written form because there's so much detail and so many characters that you almost need a guide of sorts to keep them straight. However, I didn't go that route. I went with the flow and listened to it all play out. I still loved it, but I feel like I'd like to get a more detailed handle on everything - and then listen to it all over again.<br />This is nearly 17 hours long and it took me well over a week to get through it. I love being immersed in another world for a longer period of time on occasion and this is a twisty, windy story that couldn't be rushed. There were at least three instances during this listen where I stopped in my tracks and said, \"HO-LY SH...!\"<br />Most of the people that read my reviews know that my primary love is lesbian romance. This wasn't remotely that. There is, however, a developing relationship between Gideon and Harrow that was fascinating to watch unfold. Gideon's character in particular is a hero for the ages and a piece of her will stay with me. Harrowhark is a great character too, but in a completely different way. She is young, brilliant, powerful and driven and the focus of the next book in this series so I really look forward to seeing what's next in her journey. <br />There's no question I'll have to also listen to that on audiobook narrated by Quirk as well. She manages to give unique voices to so many characters that it's like nothing I've ever heard. And it's not just that she differentiates them so well - she embodies them. I can't say enough about the quality of her work on this. I want to listen to everything she's done.<br />I could go on for days about the unique secondary characters and the unfolding of this monstrous puzzle, but folks - it's just something that just needs to be experienced. I thought it was incredible. *More than five stars*"

This is a five-star book with a two-star ending.<br /><br />So, first, the 95%. This is a story about necromancy and swords and mysteries and it’s so, so great. The worldbuilding made me happy and the main character is sarcastic and human and surrounded by bullshit and a lesbian and I loved her. Also, there’s an awesome enemies-to-friends arc in here. And just — a lot of fun, a lot of solving puzzles, a lot of giant hulking weird bone creations becoming animated and going into kill mode. Basically, there’s so much to love here. <br /><br />And now I will talk about the 5%, under a spoiler cut. <input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"spoiler__control\" aria-label=\"The following text has been marked spoiler.

Gideon, the main character, dies at the end. And it’s a great death. She chooses it, and it’s heroic, and she saves the only person she cares about saving, and ... and I don’t fucking care that it’s a great death, because it’s still a death, and I am so fucking done with lesbians dying at the end. And I really did think I’d be safe from a Bury Your Queers ending in a book written by a queer author. And on the one hand it feels unfair to this book to downgrade it and be pissed off at it because of accumulated pain and sadness, but on the other hand: no book is written in a vacuum. They’re all written in context, and the context includes a world where lesbians don’t get happy endings. They die so that other people can have those happy endings. So ... yeah, I’m gonna say my feelings are valid, and this book deserves my wrath as well as my love.</label>"

      "review": "<i> 5 stars - This was so f*cking good </i><br /><br /><br />OMg ok let me just get my thoughts together. I don't think I can explain this book any better than the blurb on the cover - \"Lesbian necromancers explore a haunted gothic palace in space!\". What more is there to love?! It is just the perfect blend of sci fi fantasy.<br /><br />If I could describe this book by relating it to other things - I would definitely say it is comparable to the movie Knives Out paired with <a href=\"https://goodreads.com/book/show/26114463.Nevernight__The_Nevernight_Chronicle___1_\" title=\"Nevernight (The Nevernight Chronicle, #1) by Jay Kristoff\" rel=\"noopener\">Nevernight</a>, but set in space.<br /><br />The wlw rep is done soo well. Even though this book is definitely not romance heavy at all, you're there with the characters experiencing same sex attraction, and it is just so nice to see these feelings presented so casually and just there - like it's so relatable! We're just following this kickass women on their quest, and they just happen to be lesbians! I'm here for it!<br /><br />And of course, the necromancy was so so cool! I don't think I've ever read a book so memorable that featured necromancy so heavily. This is definitely hard fantasy - there is a lot of lore because there are so many characters and each character is able to harness their necromantic abilities in a different way. It was so cool to see the magic system unravel. It was definitely very present in the book - it is relevant in basically every scene and conversation that happens, so this is definitely not a book I would recommend for those faint of heart when it comes to fantasy. The sci fi elements are there as well, but definitely not as present. It's basically like the necromantic magic is being used in this really advanced, multiplanet society, where space travel just occurs all the time. Pretty cool, if I do say so myself. It is really refreshing to read something that doesn't follow the traditional rules of fantasy.<br /><br />Forever, <a href=\"https://goodreads.com/book/show/26114463.Nevernight__The_Nevernight_Chronicle___1_\" title=\"Nevernight (The Nevernight Chronicle, #1) by Jay Kristoff\" rel=\"noopener\">Nevernight</a> has been my favourite novel, because there was just something about the quirkiness of the writing style, the connection with the characters and the gothic scenery that I just couldn't find in anything else. <i>Gideon the Ninth</i> is the closest I have come to finding this in anything else. The prose and the characters are definitely quirky. I will admit that it took me a while to get into this novel. The pacing and introduction of so many characters at the start definitely took me a while to get used to. However, once I reached the Third Act, things picked up immensely and I found I could barely put this down. This is exactly when the haunted gothic palace vibes kicked in, and suddenly we found ourselves in a murder mystery! The scenery of this book was just done so splendidly - I could so vividly imagine everything that was happening and see exactly how the characters were interacting with one another. SO GOOD!<br /><br />The characters were also just so gorgeous to read about. If I am being honest, I don't think much character development happened during this book, because the characters didn't change that much. Instead, the reader's understanding of the characters and why they were the way they were changed. And I loved that. It felt like an intimate character study, paired with a fast-moving plot.<br /><br />On the plot - it was definitely a bit messy, and I can see some readers disliking this. However, I just thought it was really fun. There were so many twists and turns along the way, and this book just had me constantly entertained. I also love that there are so many mysteries waiting to be solved in upcoming books, and I am just so keen to see them unravel.<br /><br />Honestly, I just adored this book. Would definitely recommend to all readers who enjoy hard, high fantasy, who are also looking for something that breaks away from traditional fantasy standards.<br /><br />****<br /><br />I am reading this as part of my Pride Month 2021 TBR.

      "review": "I didn't like this, and no one is sadder than I am about my own preference. When a friend loves a book so much, I feel a lot of things - happiness for them, anticipation for myself, and fear that if I don't like it, it's going to make my friend sad and deprive me of a good conversation with them about the book. :C When the fear ends up being \"justified\" it's just so disappointing for me.<br /><br /><i>Gideon the Ninth</i> is about a competition among the heirs of eight houses that serve the Necrolord prime in order to join him at his side as immortal Lyctors. Gideon is a cavalier for the ninth house (hence, the ninth) and joins her heir, a girl she hates named Harrow, in hopes of helping her gain Lyctorhood and in turn her own freedom.<br /><br />There is very little worldbuilding at the beginning of this book, but I wasn't as confused as I thought I would be. I understood the dynamics of the world I was tossed into, but the issue for me was that I couldn't really come to terms with the setting. For me, there seemed to be absolutely zero reason for the space part of the science fantasy. No part of this book is enhanced or even changed by the fact that all of the houses exist on different planets. I was confused as to why it was a choice made when it factors in not at all - the characters start at their house and travel once to the palace where the competition is, never leaving that location afterwards or changing setting, or even having a scene that requires space. It's a nitpick, assuredly, but I feel like I would have adjusted to the worldbuilding and familiar contempt that each house held for each other if they weren't separated by planet for seemingly no reason. It needs a sci-fi label for the tech, but I really didn't believe the \"lesbian necromancers in space!\" existed for any reason other than being able to give that tagline.<br /><br />Gideon's entire personality is \"lewd and snarky\" and doesn't really have lines that aren't crude punchlines for 75% of the book. For some people, this is cause for stanning; for me it's just a lot of built up frustration that doesn't seem to ebb out at all. I liked her at the close of the novel but to say I cared about her, or any character really, would be stretching it. There was a heavy scene that I felt moved by, but it happened late in the book, and despite having nothing to do with Gideon was framed around her feelings, and that juxtaposition bothered me.<br /><br />This is an entirely new world (as far as I'm to understand) and the multiple uses of the word mayonnaise as a descriptor didn't work for me. Early on, Gideon uses the term \"pizza face\" and I was unable to get over that small detail. I was still trying to solidify the world with the sparse worldbuilding (which is not inherently bad) and the tossing in of pizza and no less than 5 instances of calling someone \"the mayonnaise uncle\" made me feel disconnected. There's no reason for an author to avoid words when twisting language into their own world, but those two very specific things threw me out of the story. I also love the modern and crude dialogue here much more than I did in <i>Nevernight,</i> but considering how each house was on a different planets, it made very little sense for most of their dialogue to fit the same patterns, especially when <input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"spoiler__control\" aria-label=\"The following text has been marked spoiler. Toggle checkbox to reveal or hide.\" onchange=\"this.labels[0].setAttribute('aria-hidden', !this.checked);\" id=\"2988e0d3-4652-4895-8b57-57db79958df2\" /><label aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"spoiler\" for=\"2988e0d3-4652-4895-8b57-57db79958df2\">a couple of the people speaking were ten thousand years old.</label><br /><br />The competition, given the explanation for the intent behind it, didn't really make sense. <input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"spoiler__control\" aria-label=\"The following text has been marked spoiler.

When Harrow and Gideon \"merge\" into one at the end, it's after an entire book of competition and murder, tied with a communications ban that seemed to exist only to further isolate them. Iunno, it just didn't really make sense as a resolution.</label><br /><br />And now - the trope I really can't stand in books for personal reasons. Early on in the book, as soon as Gideon and Harrow land at the first house, we meet a sick and disabled character named Dulcinea. She is pathetic, coughing up blood and barely able to hold herself up. Warning bells immediately went off in my head because I've been down this road before. <input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"spoiler__control\" aria-label=\"The following text has been marked spoiler. Toggle checkbox to reveal or hide.\" onchange=\"this.labels[0].setAttribute('aria-hidden', !this.checked);\" id=\"a09063bd-40b6-4d8f-98db-f024511b70fb\" /><label aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"spoiler\" for=\"a09063bd-40b6-4d8f-98db-f024511b70fb\">We don't suspect the disabled girl, the pathetically adorable sick little thing, and then it's all a guise!!! Disability is used as the ultimate disguise because disabled people would never be capable of things and can just be disregarded. The book tries at one point to paint her sickness as a \"benefit\" to her magic which also felt very weird and reminiscent of Carve the Mark. &lt;.&lt; Well, here, my example above is not exactly how it plays out, but it's somehow worse. Here it's a ten thousand year old imposter (She takes over the role of the originally sick heir after she dies in order to infiltrate the competition) Lyctor who was sick when she became immortal and has been dying without death this entire time. And what does that result in? Oh just her hating everyone and everything and wanting to destroy the Necrolord and his entire universe, of course. Because disability is so horrible that it renders someone who was \"sweet\" and \"smart\" (the Necrolord speaks highly of her at the close of the book) into a crazy and evil psychopath. Now, I'm not saying my lupus-ridden ass would enjoy ten thousand years of sickness, but I don't appreciate that being the taste I'm left with in my mouth. There isn't really another way for me to look at it either - she wants to destroy the person who made her \"suffer\" by living chronically ill for so long. What a pain. I don't know if this trope is noticeable to people who don't live chronically ill or disabled, but to get representation in a book only to have our experiences painted as something either pathetic or capable of causing insanity, it's a punch to the gut. I don't blame the author, I just don't feel good reading that.</label><br /><br />There's more I could say, but I'm rambling on and kinda grumpy. I wanted to like this book - I really did. I think I'm just a weird amalgam of traits and opinions that made this book hit me wrong. I hope other people love it as much as my friends did.<br /><br />1/5"

      "review": "I really, really enjoyed this, and I’m taking a star off, for Jesus. I mean that literally: Christian allegories have always struck me as a bit of a bummer. I’ve also never liked Easter because I struggle with the story of the Resurrection, which this book is enormously fond of. But I’m already getting ahead of myself. Let’s begin with a few warnings, because there are a surprising number of ways this might not work for you (it’s definitely more of an acquired taste, despite it’s broad popularity): <br /><br /><b>First, <i>Gideon the Ninth</i> requires an investment.</b><br /><br />This book demands you pay close attention, and won’t hesitate to punish you if you don’t. You’re either a fan of this type of concentrated reading experience, or you aren’t (I am). You’re either in the right mood for it, or you aren’t (I was). I read the first 45 pages, realized I was in for a workout, immediately re-read those first 45 pages more carefully, and from then on, continually flipped between the text, its immensely helpful character guide, and a dictionary (this book is obsessed with arcane or obscure vocabulary words). Through this close reading, I didn’t unlock deeper levels, symbolism, or mysteries; I was simply rewarded with a basic comprehension of what was going on, and I never experienced the lost quality others reported. I read like I was doing it for school and the pay-off was that I could follow along, which won’t be to everyone’s taste. <br /><br /><b>Secondly, <i>Gideon the Ninth</i> is pretentious.</b> <br /><br />Listen: I’m a huge fan of this book, and I’d still say this is inarguable. As the arcane and obscure vocabulary words suggest, this book is desperate to show you how smart and cool it is. Like the text generally, its characters trip over themselves to prove how mysterious, disaffected, and irreverent they are, when they’re not busy showing off their outrageous talents or prodigious skill. For some, this alone will be a non-starter, which I understand. But I found it immensely endearing, perhaps because I was once a posturing show-off teen girl with a bad attitude, desperately searching for love and approval, and pathetically uncomfortable with revealing how I really felt, just as these characters are. To repudiate Gideon, Harrow, or this book would be to reject my previous young-person-self, which I don’t have the heart for. <br /><br />Of course, the pretension is easier to forgive as the book succeeds. Although it never condescends to explain its world building, <i>Gideon the Ninth</i> commits 110% to its sunglasses-wearing, sword-wielding heroine and the gothic ethos she exists in, and the result is oodles and oodles of style. And because this book has been lavished with praise for its originality and inventiveness, perhaps it has become easy to overlook how original and inventive it really is. For me, this combination of awe-inspiring creativity and goth girl design was too delightful to resist. <br /><br /><b>Finally, <i>Gideon the Ninth</i> is religious. </b><br /><br />Ah, now we’ve come to the meat of the matter! When I was doing my first 45 pages re-read, I was increasingly surprised by how Catholic this book is – I mean, it’s got a group of veiled nuns, praying on rosaries of bone, in a structure that exactly matches a cathedral. It’s certainly not subtle, but the whole “lesbian necromancers explore a haunted gothic palace in space!” thing acts as quite the distraction. Aside from the Catholic associations I’ve already mentioned, the world building of this book relies heavily on medieval Europe, which was a time and place in which the church was uniquely dominant. This book’s social system is feudal, religious leaders and titled landowners occupy privileged positions at the top of this hereditary hierarchy, and the leader of this civilization – the immortal Emperor – acts as Pope. Which was all well and good: medieval Europe is fun! Catholic stuff is stylish! <br /><br />Except we eventually walk right into a wall. Because this isn’t just an inherently Catholic book that re-imagines medieval Europe with fondness and style – it’s also a Christian allegory. And I’m not sure we can have both: <br /><br /><b> *** AND FAIR WARNING, SPOILERS AHEAD: ***</b> <br /><br />Gideon is a serf. Serfdom is an oppressive system that stripped its victims (the serfs) of agency and self-determination. <br /><br />Gideon is also a Christ figure, <i>choosing</i> to embrace suffering and death to save others. <br /><br />The book can’t have it both ways. It consistently and thoroughly problematizes Gideon’s lack of agency and self-determination, until it imbues her with those same qualities, so she may “heroically” choose self-annihilation. And all to further empower the person who oppressed her! Her death only makes sense if she is a martyr who died for the sins of necromancy generally and Harrow specifically (Harrow being unusually aware of Original Sin, as she was born the direct beneficiary of power from the massacre of innocent children). <br /><br />I found this ending profoundly uncomfortable, even though I saw it on the horizon and tried to prepare myself for it. <br /><br />It also raises a lot of questions for the direction of the rest of the narrative, considering this is only one book of a planned trilogy. <br /><br />I think it’s safe to assume Gideon hasn’t truly died. If she’s Jesus, her death is only the opening step in a process of resurrection that will ensure her exulted return. She’ll be back, transfigured and more powerful. But, within the world that this book has built, she’s a single serf among many. She’s not even the only cavalier whose soul has been used in this particular process of oppression – there were at least 9 others that we know of. If Gideon and Gideon alone returns, but the necromancers continue to systematically abuse and murder everyone else, will readers be satisfied? Will it be enough, if this Second Coming punishes “bad” necromancers and rewards “good” ones? I sit uneasily in these questions. <br /><br />In the end, I still love this book. Even as I write this and wade through my discomfort with its theology, I want to pick it up and re-read the whole thing. I can’t stop thinking about it, and on a really basic level, it was a ton of fun. It honors its queer teenage girl protagonists and their sharp edges and softer hearts, which is an achievement I’m deeply grateful for. "

      "review": "Oh, man. <br /><br />Prologue: I went into this book tentatively, having seen it breathlessly recommended in the same over-the-top language that so often ends up leading to disappointment, or to a sort of \"this book has all these cool buzzwords in it and so I'm going to LIKE IT despite whatever half-hearted actual paint-by-numbers content is actually in it\" mindless enthusiasm that always surrounds the type of book with a \"lesbian necromancers in space\"-esque blurb. Other warning signs: the basic \"a girl fighter! a Hunger Games-style competition! a Harry Potter-esque Houses with Characteristics dynamic!\", all of which is just everywhere in the awful glut of bad, predictable, half-written YA fantasy that's out there right now. Anyway: I was prepared to try it, and to probably hate it. I was prepared for it to be all concept and very little substance; or for it to have a thin veneer of concept and very little <i>anything</i>. <br /><br />Happily--thrillingly, delightedly, and honestly almost instantly--I realized that I was wrong. This book is <i>good</i>. This was one of those books where, a few (gorgeously, lushly black-edged) pages in, I realized that despite the crackiness of the concept and the Edgy Teen-ness of the language, this book was going to be good. It was going to be good <i>because</i> of those things. This book was confident and competent and crackling with energy, and it wasn't pandering to me by info-dumping the Characteristics of the Houses or the Way the Magic Works right up front, and it was all going to be okay, and I was--safe. It's very rare for me to find a book where, before the first chapter ends, I can let go of the part of my brain that's trying to decide if this book is even good, and I can relax into the story, because I know this author is going to take care of me. <br /><br /><i>Gideon</i> took care of me. All the things that other reviewers have complained about were some of the best parts of the book, to me--the story is incredibly dense and the world-building is hard to understand. I like that; it's a challenge, it's a constant discovery, it carries you through the two hundred pages before the central mystery plot really takes off. The thin-ness of the world seemed entirely intentional to me: there are two more books where, I assume, questions like \"is this entire society designed solely for constant, endless intergalactic warfare?\" and \"are there even Normal People on these alleged planets?\" will be answered. We ARE in the dark, as readers, and I like it. I love it. Here is a world to come to know, and here is an adventure to whirl us into it. <br /><br />And--here are characters to lead us through it, bitterly and grudgingly and heartbreakingly. Another thing I've seen other reviews complain about is the Dirtbag Teen-ness of the language and the POV, and to me, that was another one of the most artful aspects of the book--we're so distracted by Gideon's foul mouth and fouler attitude that we barely see her big-heartedness, her warmth and longing and love, sneak up on us until it's far too late. I was poleaxed by the emotion in this book, laid out by it. If you are looking for a real, true enemies to friends to ?? book, this is the one. This is how it's done--slowly and meanly, in starts and stops and fits of betrayal and sacrifice, in the midst of a larger plot and story with real stakes, woven into the fabric of that story in thin and shining threads. Just enough to give you something, and to leave you wanting more, and to utterly destroy you.<br /><br />The tragedy of it is that all I want now is to talk about this book, and very few people I know in real life will read it, and fewer will love it. I do think this is a strange and specific book, maybe too irreverent for some SF/F fans and too gory and grim for some romance fans and too dense and complex and grudging for some YA fans. Or maybe I'm being as reductive now as I was when I first heard about this book. Anyway, give it a try--I think it's brilliant.<br /><br /><i>For more of my thoughts about this book and all the other books I'll read this month, check out my newsletter, <a href=\"http://cokey.substack.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">A Month of Strong Opinions</a>.</i>"

      "review": "Technically it's a 3.5 for me!<br /><br />Not what I expected at all! I found the 1st third of the book tough to understand. I wish I had realized 2 things going into it. First, Gideon isn't a necromancer. Upon realization, the wind beneath my sails full of excitement and zeal to read completely disappeared. It definitely explains why the 1st third was slow for me to get through because it focuses so much on Gideon. I really picked up interest when all the other characters were introduced. And second, there are DIFFERENT types of necromancy. I was worried the glossary in the back would spoil stuff so I didn't familiarize myself with some of the terms. <br /><br />BTW, the naming section on the back of the book contains spoilers. <br /><br />And I'm not sure if it was strange marketing or my own misunderstanding. Regardless, the rest of the book more than made up for the weird start. <br /><br />It gave me Agatha Christie, murder mystery party vibes. I loved the atmosphere. And what really stood out to me was the action scenes. The physical combat and necromancy elements were so well described! This book isn't afraid of strong heroines, bad jokes, and gritty detail. The romance plot was lite (and I'm only mentioning it because it is on so many queer and lesbian mc booklists), but I respect the choice to keep it minimal because these is so much else going on. It is a little tough to keep track of all the characters but I wrote down a little description for each person and used that as a quick reference. <br /><br />Overall, be patient with it. It's the 1st in a series with a very cool magic idea that felt very original to me.<br /><br /><br /><br />Okay and wait I have the tiniest little additional gripe! The author uses the word \"titanic\" 5 times. It really took me out of the reading. I know it's supposed to mean \"really big\" but it just made me imagine a giant ship in the middle of combat each time lol.<br /><br />Okay okay, my second gripe is that Gideon is only 18 and Harrow is 17. How could Gideon have SO MANY escape attempts??? Unfortunately this is so common in YA or New Adult Fantasy that it barely registers to me and I automatically add +5 to their ages."

      "review": "A tricky, tricky book to review. At first, I was irritated by Gideon - she seemed like she was trying too hard to be funny. Over the course of the book, I grew fonder and fonder of her, largely because so much messed-up, murder-y stuff was happening that her personality came to seem like the only reasonable response to the plot. And then, of course, Gideon sacrifices herself so that Harrow can become a Lyctor and defeat Cytherea, which seems like such a huge waste! Gideon is a far more endearing character than Harrow, and I still have unanswered questions about her origins.<br /><br />This is actually a consistent trend in this novel: the characters I'm most fond of (Palamedes...) end up dead or worse, leaving me to read on about characters I'm at best neutral about. It's like the story itself is eating up all the good souls.<br /><br />Speaking of the story: I was pleasantly surprised when the \"pass these trials to gain power/position\" premise transformed into something more like a horror movie, with characters getting picked off one by one by an unseen monster. The genre shift was nicely wrought, and not something I've come across before.<br /><br />I've also never come across a book about lesbian necromancers before. And maybe I still haven't. There's tons of necromancy in here, but none of the mechanics are explained very well. Gideon is clearly a lesbian, and the portrayal of her feelings for Dulcinea and attraction to Coronabeth is very relatable for a wlw. But I came in expecting some level of queer romance, and what I got instead was a) Gideon falling for Dulcinea but she was an evil impostor all along, and b) Gideon sacrificing her life for Harrow after minimal development from, you know, being mortal enemies with a lot of history. It's a bit disappointing."

      "review": "Gideon the Ninth is a highly ambitious book with a unique premise, interesting mashup of many things, and some very intriguing concepts that is fumbled by fundamental storytelling shortcomings that don’t necessarily make this a less fun book to read, but certainly a more difficult one, and a potential turn off for some readers. Let me explain. <br /><br />I apparently have a lot to say about this book, certainly not all of it bad, but there are differing opinions to the majority of the readers online. I love when people are able to find a book they love and connect with, but I also want to be true to my thoughts and reactions, having read this book, and first in a quartet. I would say a truer rating of the book is 3.5 stars, but I rounded up for uniqueness. Also, I really appreciated how many women are in the book, and that the finale is literally a fight between 5 women. How often do you get to see that, especially in fantasy or science fiction?<br /><br />I love the concept of this book, or at least started to love it once I figured out the proper tone it was going for. Lesbian necromancers? Hell yeah. Necromancers paired with cavaliers? Like ladies and knights (but less gender conformist) – sign me up! A murder mystery and competition set in basically a locked haunted house? I’m so there. Enemies to lovers? HOW DO I GET THIS BOOK. I tried to apply my fantasy trope brain to the book when I started it, but it felt off and I couldn’t connect. However, 10% in, I switched my brain from Howard Shore to Joan Jett and it clicked – this was a gothic punk book with attitude and irreverence. Then I could get on board. <br /><br />And yet, the genre bending still gave me trouble, as well as the conflicting tones and references. For some, this may not be an issue, but I find I like consistency to some degree in my books, and Gideon the Ninth wanted to go everywhere:<br />      -   It’s a murder mystery adventure story – that’s a malleable genre and can be applied to just about everything.<br /><br />      -   There’s a huge fantasy feel to the whole book with traditions, religions, orders, swords, necromantic magic – that makes sense. Necromancy is magic, which lends itself nicely to the genre. <br /><br />      -   It’s set in space – ok, given the fantasy vibes I was getting before, this now starts to feel like two contrasting atmospheres clashing. However, somehow, there wasn’t even enough space, but too much to be invisible. They all live on different planets and travel to the Fifth House in shuttles, but then they’re just in this old house full of skeletons and decaying furniture. Oh, and there’s hair dryers and flashlights, I think. <br /><br />      -   There’s modern day language, references, and sensibilities peppered in with the older school fantasy vibes. Here’s where the cracks lengthen. Now the book feels more than just conflicting atmospheres, but also tones. It’s not impossible to do (think Firefly as a space western and A Knight’s Tale as an anachronistic medieval film), but in my mind, those took the values and elements that paired well together and blended them to either achieve the right message or vibe. Think Marie Antoinette with modern music and Chuck Taylors – by giving these modern day references, the director can give a better sense of reference and context for modern day audiences. <br /><br />In this case, the references and language just feel jarring and inconsistent. Gideon makes “that’s what she said references”, wears aviators, and knows what soda cans are, but has never seen a sink or shower? <br /><br />I heard on a podcast the statement (from author or reviewer, I cannot remember) that there are pop culture references and there are Catholic references, and who are you to say which are correct or high brow? To that I say neither is technically correct or even highbrow, (IMO just because Catholicism has been around much longer than 2000s tv show humor doesn’t necessarily make it more highbrow). However, it is my opinion that the wielder of such references cannot be ignorant or dismissive of the tone and weight of said references. Referencing medieval religion carries a much different tone than a “that’s what she said reference” or calling someone “doll” like a 1920s gangster movie, and to be dismissive of reader’s confusion or qualms with conflicting tones feels reductive and purposefully obtuse. However, I understand the sentiment behind the original opinion, which is to say that many people immediately dismiss pop culture references as childish or short lived. <br /><br />But I’m being too focused on minor details, and thus, I digress.<br />My biggest problems with the book were the confusing and vague worldbuilding, the pacing, and the overabundance of characters. <br />The writing is either intentionally vague and confusing, or I am just stupid. However, I’ve heard the confusing comment from many other readers, so I’m hoping it’s the former. It puts me off when I am left floundering with descriptions, that even with lengthy descriptions and visual exposition, I can barely imagine what people look like or what the environment looks like. I felt like I had no idea what was happening or what anything looked like for most of the book (except Gideon and Harrowhark, and I’d argue that they’re the most important to nail down), and it left me frustrated that the author could have thrown a life preserver or something instead of laughing at me flailing about in open water. <br /><br />For many, this may not be an issue, but for me, I love when the writing paints a picture for me, and this book did not provide me with a large canvas and full set of paints; it left me a broken crayon and pegboard.<br /><br />You may have seen another note from reviewers that you will spend most of the book wondering what the hell is going on, and that the finale is an exceptional payoff. I completely agree - the pacing is slow in the first half, then picks up steam in most of the second half, with a race to the finish in the last 15%. This is not the first book I’ve read where there is a long build up and worldbuilding set up in the beginning with an exceptional, explosive ending - I’m looking at you, Gentleman Bastards. <br /><br />However, the difference to me is the quality of the world building, descriptions, and characters. In Lies of Locke Lamora (a very different book, but the closest I can think of in terms of similar pacing), the world building and descriptions painted a vibrant picture of the world and magical elements (although some of those elements also felt a bit vague, simply due to their nature), with a very thorough fleshing out of this magical world the author concocted, and a few memorable characters. Gideon the Ninth felt like it was attempting to achieve that, but is too much of a hot mess. And I think it’s also unfair of me to draw comparisons to two extremely different books, but it’s the closest I can do to give context for my position. <br /><br />As I read this book, I couldn’t shake the thought that it could have used a more ruthless editor to even out the pace, trim down some of the vague, flowery language, and cut or combine scenes that felt like they contained filler, especially Gideon wandering the castle and taking a vow of silence, which felt boring and inconsistent to her character, but I’ll get into characters in a bit. <br /><br />The second half of the book is certainly exciting and enjoyable to the max, with cavaliers challenging each other, murders, a mysterious challenge laid down by a dead lich, and an unknown but powerful and magical force that is picking them off. The author certainly succeeds at pitting the different houses against each other and building up the tension that one can only imagine would pile up when trapped in a house with a murderous someone or something and a race against the clock to beat the other teams. <br /><br />The final act was by far the best and most exciting – the fights felt like there were real stakes with no shortage of gravity, and a struggle against an insanely powerful villain. It incorporated themes or lessons that Gideon and Harrow learned over the course of this adventure, and cemented their ability to work together. <br /><br />This works because by now you have a true relationship between two characters that we’ve seen grow and change since the beginning. And honestly, I wanted more of Gideon and Harrow. I loved how much at odds they were in the beginning and how much they truly hated and resented each other. <br /><br />It felt like true, organic, and slow relationship change. It never felt like an “oh I hate your guts ooh but you’re so attractive that I RIGHT AWAY cannot help but imagine you naked”. It felt more like a reasonable amount of time to morph from years of hurt and your own baggage and prejudices to a more honest and equal relationship that is only achievable through vulnerability, which gives the characters time to grow closer, build trust, and better understand each other. <br /><br />But there are swaths in the beginning where Harrow goes off on her own and tells Gideon to take a vow of silence and not search for her, and for someone who seems stubborn and disobedient, Gideon obeys Harrow and wanders the First House, not speaking a word to anyone. It’s boring and frankly felt like filler, as well as inconsistent with Gideon’s character, who sometimes only acts like a smartass when it’s convenient for the plot. <br /><br />In spite of that, I loved Gideon and Harrow overall – a crass, confident, and snarky cavalier to a grave, ambitious, and ruthless necromancer. They played off each other very well, and once again, I loved their relationship. Gideon brings a great amount of levity and attitude to the book. I also enjoyed Magnus the Fifth, Dulcinaea, the weird trio of the Third (pale weirdo Ianthe, glowing and beautiful Coronabeth, and their pompous and vain cavalier, Naberius), and eventually, Palamedes and Camilla of the Sixth house. <br /><br />However, there are a TON of characters in this book, some of whom just seem to serve as fodder and you don’t really get to know all of them. Some feel very two dimensional, and everyone has many names to be referred to: first name, last name, house (Like Ninth, or Sixth), and even nicknames. As such, it would have been helpful for me to take character notes to keep them better sorted in my head. Is that the fault of the author, making too many characters to keep track of? Eh, maybe. I think it depends on genre and pay off, and I’m on the fence about payoff. <br /><br />Ultimately, it comes down to either helpful advice for future readers, so as they can be prepared when reading or decide that this kind of thing is a dealbreaker and choose not to read the book in the first place.<br /><br />I hope this review doesn’t make it seem like I did not enjoy my time reading this book. Sure, it’s mostly confusing and there are fairly significant detractors (your milage may vary, as it is with every such book), but there was still plenty that I loved. The concept, the attitude, several of the characters, and the locked house puzzle were more than enough to carry me through the book. <br />Based on what I have read about the sequel, which is even MORE confusing than the first book, I think I know myself enough to know when to pull out. That’s what she said. <br /><br />Although I don’t regret reading this first in a series, I know enough to know that there will be diminishing returns for me, and there is only so much time on this planet to read the myriad books that I want to.

It’s definitely not perfect but I think it’s worth reading, and I’ll be reading book two for sure.<br /><br />For you if: You are looking for more queer sci-fi/fantasy in your life!<br /><br /><b>FULL REVIEW:</b><br /><br /><blockquote>\n  <i>Her adept said: \"I'll keep it off you. Nav, show them what the Ninth House does.\"<br /><br />Gideon lifted her sword. The construct worked itself free of its last confines of masonry and rotten wood and heaved before them, flexing itself like a butterfly.<br /><br />\"We do bones, motherfucker,\" she said.</i>\n</blockquote><br /><br /><i>Gideon the Ninth</i> — described with the promising words “Lesbian necromancers in space!!” — is super hyped, and it was nominated for the Hugo. Readers seem to either love it or find it disappointing, with no in between. Well, I’m that in between. At the end of the day, though, I thought this book was imperfect but really, really fun, and I’m definitely planning to read the second one soon.<br /><br /><b>The disappointing first half:</b> I struggled with the first half of the book. The opening chapter is fun and sets the stage well, with a foul-mouthed, sarcastic, fierce main character. But from there, it really gets bogged down. The world-building is not great — information was presented without much explanation. It asked too much of the reader as we “listen in” on world-building conversations — which is a lot of pressure and also distracting to try to remember it all. I felt like I was left by the author to sink or swim, to just keep up.<br /><br />Also, certain things felt like they were done for the plot’s sake without being true to the character, like Gideon’s willingness to take a vow of silence around all the other houses. Why would she do that? I also felt that the mystery and suspense was built sloppily. Multiple times, a character was interrupted right before they were about to say something important — like “I can only conclude that the murder happened by…” and then NO ONE went back and demanded that they finish their thought when the interruption passed. Even to solve a murder!! It was totally unrealistic and just felt sort of lazy. <br /><br />Finally, I was so incredibly tired of Gideon and Harrow being enemies. It just went on WAY too long. Basically, I struggled with it until things finally picked up in the second half.<br /><br /><b>The great second half:</b> There was one specific moment — a WHAT THE ACTUAL EFF moment — where I knew I’d hit the part where it was about to get good. I could have used that plot escalation at like the 25% mark instead of the 60-ish% mark, but it’s all good. Once we hit that point of no return, I was absolutely sucked in. Things moved fast, characters started growing and changing, central questions were answered, and evil plots were uncovered. The ending completely surprised me, and I need to know what happens next. I’ll be reading book two very soon, and I’m hoping it carries over the energy that the second half of this book built.<br /><br />TL; DR: Set aside your critical eye, read this one for fun, and stick with it. I think it’s worth it.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>TRIGGER WARNINGS:</b><br />Violence and some gore"

      "review": "The tagline on the cover of this book is “Lesbian necromancers explore a haunted gothic palace in space! Decadent nobles vie to serve the deathless emperor! Skeletons!” I will say that sums the book up pretty nicely with a caveat: I don’t know why they had to specify that the necromancers were lesbians. In fact, it was such a subtle part of the plot that if they wouldn’t have specifically pointed it out I would barely notice at all. Basically, the main character (Gideon {who is a girl and not a necromancer}) finds other girls attractive periodically throughout the novel. That’s it. And the cover for the second book was just released yesterday and one of the tweets promoting the cover is “The necromancers are back, and they’re gayer than ever.” Again, I imagine that book is not going to be overtly gay, but whatever. I digress. Actually, I haven’t even really started. So anyway, the book was kind of hard to get into at first because the world was so drastically different that the one that we inhabit. Basically, there are nine “houses” (which I think they just mean different planets that have each developed their own specific culture to serve the first “house”, like the ninth house is supposedly the guardians of the locked tomb, which they barely touch on so I’m not totally sure what that even means. The only time they really talk about it is when Harrow {the necromancer of the ninth} breaks in to it as a little girl and finds that there is just a corpse of another little girl in there and when her parents find out that she broke into the tomb they both hang themselves and Harrow ends up necromanting them both so everyone still thinks they are alive {except Gideon, who walked in on the mess} until the story actually starts when Harrow is 17ish {and Gideon is 19ish}) who each have their own nobility and power structure. The first house is the one that has the “deathless emperor” in it and the other houses are subservient to the first. The rest of the houses seem to be relatively equal other than the minor squabbles that would happen between like sports teams or whatever. ANYWAY, each house gets called to send a dignitary to go to this “haunted palace” (Caanan House) and they are supposed to send an adept (read: necromancer) and a cavalier (read: necromancer’s bodyguard). When they all get to Caanan House, they are met by this guy called the Teacher and he tells them there is only one rule: don’t go into any locked door without permission. So Harrow (the crafty bitch), starts cataloguing all of the doors that she can find and she finds like more than 200 doors on the first night and there are only like 6 locked ones (spoiler alert: there are actually 8 locked doors {one for each of the houses other than the first}). ANYWAY, Gideon (Harrow’s cavalier {although she wasn’t originally the cavalier [because Gideon and Harrow hate each other] but Harrow’s original cavalier escaped on the shuttle that was meant for Gideon to escape from right at the beginning of the book [because she hated the ninth house] but that cavalier ended up getting blown up because the ship was booby-trapped}) ends up finding another locked door and hides it away so no one else can find it. Yadda, yadda, yadda, it turns into a mystery novel for a while here: people start dying, people start trying to figure out who could have killed them (there are only 16 necromancers/cavaliers and like 3 priests + Teacher so there aren’t that many people there {a pretty familiar dynamic if you are familiar with Agatha Christie novels}) blah blah blah. There are tests that the necromancers have to complete behind each locked door and once they complete them they gain access to these necromantic formulas that made them better necromancers (OH I forgot to mention, the reason these necromancers are there is because they are all trying to become “Lyctors” which just seem to be ultra-powerful, literally undead, necromancers who assist the “deathless emperor” in these seemingly manifest destiny-type wars across the universe {that they are apparently losing because they need new Lyctors because the old ones are dying}) and they suspect that the way to become a Lyctor is to study these formulas and unlock the “megatheorem” that ties all of the spells together. All that stuff happens for a while, there’s conflict between the houses, there’s alliances between the houses, there’s friendship, there’s enemyship, BUT there is no romance (again besides Gideon finding other chicks attractive sometimes) so AGAIN I don’t know why they had to point this out (as you can probably tell, I’m hung up on this. Mind you, I have no problem with gay characters, but it had PRETTY MUCH NOTHING TO DO WITH THE PLOT!! UGH!). Let me reiterate, no romance. Again, that’s fine with me. Moving on. Getting to the end soon. So it turns out that one of the necromancers that was from the seventh house WASN’T ACTUALLY THE NECROMANCER FROM THE SEVENTH HOUSE!!!!!!!!! WH-WHA-WHAT!?!? Turns out, that crazy bee-otch was one of the original Lyctors and was trying to screw up this contest(?) or whatever the heck was going on so that the ”deathless emperor” would show up so that she could kill him (not sure why, maybe it’s because he kept these {in my opinion} pointless wars going for ten thousand years) but then you find out that the only way to become a Lyctor is to have the cavalier sacrifice themselves so that the necromancer “absorb” their soul so that the necromancer can draw on the dead cavalier’s “thanergy” (what they called the death energy that necromancers use to power their magic) in an unlimited capacity. I’ll know if you read this whole thing only if you email me back specifically, “You write the best book reviews John and I’ll never be as funny as you”. Well, as the book has been going on, Gideon and Harrow don’t seem to hate each other as much, frenemies, if you will (Side note: spell check did not say that “frenemies” is not a word. I’m not sure how I feel about that). So, pretty much everyone is dead at this point (sorry I skipped over a bunch of the deaths) and its basically Gideon, Harrow, and the sixth’s cavalier, Camilla. And they are all hurt real bad but they are still fighting this Lyctor that’s trying to kill the emperor, but the emperor hasn’t shown up yet, so there is this big battle scene with blood and bone and boring boring boring. Just a big-a** fight scene. If you’ve read one, you’ve read them all. They end up killing her. As if they wouldn’t have. Bleh. I’m just annoyed with the whole dynamic of, “oh, there is this super-duper all powerful thing and we are just never going to beat them and there is no way at all…oh, wait a minute, what if we work together? Could companionship overcome this seemingly insurmountable obstacle? Oh my! It worked! All it took was for us to believe in ourselves and get over our differences and we were able to defy the odds! After we realized that we just need to work together, the same sword stab to the heart that didn’t kill her before now, miraculously, kills her!” Bleh. Oh, and I forgot to mention that Gideon ends up sacrificing herself (idiot) to pair with Harrow so that Harrow can become a Lyctor. I suppose that helped in defeating the old Lyctor as well, but whatever. ANYWAY, then the emperor shows up, and Harrow is pissed because Gideon sacrificed herself and it turns out that Harrow loved her all along (WH-WHA-WHAT?!?) but she just didn’t realize it. Dumb. And then the emperor leaves a bit to be desired. He basically shows up and he’s like, “Oh darn, sorry it all went wrong and pretty much everybody died. Wanna be my right hand and fight these silly pointless wars with me?” And Harrow is like, all serious, “I will be your Lyctor, Lord, if you will have me.” Boom. Done. End of Book. Overall, I give it:<br /><br /> <br /><br />Three and a half thumbs up. Out of five thumbs. Because that’s how thumbs work. It was interesting enough for me to read the second one which was only just announced so it doesn’t have a release date yet. ANYWAY, I’m going to be moving on to Chuck Klosterman IV: A Decade of Curious People and Dangerous Ideas. It’s a collection of essays but I don’t know much more about it than that. I really like Chuck Klosterman as an author, he writes pretty absurdist stuff but in a highly intellectual manner. I like to call it “Stupid Intellectualism” (patent pending).<br /><br />I hope this satisfies your desire to know about the book."

      "review": "Okay! So!<br /><br />I finished the lesbian space necromancer book! And I have THOUGHTS!<br /><br />First—just wanna say, I LOVED this book. It’s a great adventure, loads of action SWORD FIGHTING IN SPACE! So much fun. Loads of sarcasm. Tons of morbid humor. Totally my thing. And no talking down to readers when it throws around medical terminology. I. Seriously. Loved. It.<br /><br />BUT! And here be the spoiler ...<br /><br />The villain is a cancer survivor with active disease.<br /><br />This isn’t problematic in and of itself. It’s actually pretty fucking cool, if you ask me.<br /><br />See, all the magic in this book (that we know about) is derived from necromancy. Death is basically necromancy fuel. So if you’re in a state of dying, you are, potentially, really powerful.<br /><br />I think that’s pretty cool. It’s a concept I’ve been playing with in my own fiction.<br /><br />I also appreciated that the main character, Gideon, is sweet on our cancer-y villain because she’s pretty and likes romance novels and isn’t a dick. Not because she’s a precious little dying angel or “an inspiration.” That was actually really nice.<br /><br />Where things get a little dicey is the explanation for WHY our Cancer Villain is killing people.<br /><br />There are a few different explanations proposed by the book in different spots. The one time a character asks the villain WHY, she redirects the question and doesn’t really answer it, other than to sort of say that the power she has (basically a form of immortality that’s fueled by necromancy) is perverse and no one should have it.<br /><br />Okayyy.<br /><br />A more believable explanation is hinted at in the book. Apparently, planets are invaded first by a force that kills a shit ton of people to generate enough death for the necromancers to do their work. And. I mean. That’s pretty shitty. One of the things that our villain says is that she is “The revenge of ten billion.” So maybe that’s it.<br /><br />Buuut that’s not the explanation that’s really showcased as her motivation.<br /><br />After the dust has settled and one of our major characters is talking to the Main Dude that Cancer Villain wanted to exact revenge on ... our Main Dude says that it’s because she was made to live ten thousand years in pain and because he wouldn’t let her die.<br /><br />Huh?<br /><br />The reason why I bring this up is because it skirts kinda close to the notion that it’s not worth living with disability or chronic illness or chronic pain—that those of us who have conditions like this are better off dead.<br /><br />And. Well. Um.<br /><br />The decision to die because of pain or because of chronic illness tends to be a lot more nuanced than “I’m in pain and better off dead.” It’s extremely personal to the individual making the decision. For a more nuanced story of one cancer patient who chose to stop treatment, go look up the article “When to Say When” on Lacuna Loft’s website (if you google the name of the article and the name of the website, the article will be in the first couple results).<br /><br />Personally, I’d really love to get away from the idea that the chronically ill should just kick the bucket.<br /><br />And, TO BE CLEAR, Cancer Villain says MULTIPLE TIMES—when she’s still posing as a regular ol’ mortal necromancer—that she’s there seeking immortality specifically because she DOESN’T want to die.<br /><br />But this “just lemme die” explanation is given quite a bit of narrative weight. It’s given at the very end of the book. Given by our Main Dude, who has known Cancer Villain for millennia.<br /><br />I, personally, think Main Dude is full of shit. And I’m hoping that the narrative over the next couple books shows that he’s an ableist dickwad and/or a liar. There are seeds already planted in this book to show that his explanation is bullshit.<br /><br />But this makes me think about larger issues with regard to writing and how we as writers handle problematic issues/characters/situations.<br /><br />I don’t think it’s wrong to portray problematic shit. I don’t think it’s wrong to have characters who espouse problematic views. I don’t even think that it’s wrong to have those characters be your main characters. <br /><br />But I DO think that, if you’re gonna go there, you need to make some narrative decisions that show those things/characters to be problematic. ‘Cause if you don’t, you run the risk of looking like you, the writer, espouse those views, too.<br /><br />(Some fellow writers may disagree with me. That’s cool.)<br /><br />Now. Don’t get me wrong. I’m going to continue reading this series. I adored this book. This author is friggin brilliant. And no, I don’t think the author is ableist. I think Main Dude is ableist/a liar. And there are two more books for us to learn that Nothing Is As It Seems. :)<br /><br />Anyway. This is really freaking long, and I’m basically spilling all this virtual ink over a few lines at the very end of the book. Buuut I felt like it’s important to say.<br /><br />Do I rec the book? Heck yes. There’s a reason I gave it 5 stars. Just know that this is in there.<br /><br />"

THIS AINT IT, this feels like SUPERCORP.<br />Im so dissapointed cause i was hoping for a cool lesbian book, but it was not.<br />I hope that the seconds book is better and if there isnt ANY representation dont put it on the cover, please.<br />This is a mild review, if i left a review the second i finished this book it wouldnt be as pleasant"

      "review": "My boyfriend and I have been buddy reading recently and it's been really healthy for our relationship. He is typically a high fantasy/ sci-fi guy and I am not so our reads have been intriguing and kind of outside of our comfort zones. We chose to read Gideon the Ninth because it's been lauded as 'lesbian necromancers in space', I mean how could we not. The description is correct but it's also so much more than that. I expected romance too but there isn't really overwhelming amounts, the characters are clearly queer but romance isn't the focus it is friendship and surviving and I love how much it normalizes queer characters.<br /><br />Here's the plot briefly: Gideon is a child of the ninth house but not officially, she just ended up there. There is only one contemporary, the reverend daughter: Harrowhark, a necromancer and also Gideon's nemesis. All Gideon wants is freedom. Harrowhark along with the heirs of all the houses in their universe receive an invitation to compete to serve as immortal Lyctor, faithful of the Emperor God. But Harrow has a problem, she needs a Cavalier and offers Gideon her freedom in exchange for her service. Suddenly, Gideon and Harrow are transported to a murderous competition of wits with the other houses. This book is like a darker, funnier, and more sword-ful Hunger Games.<br /><br />This book was such a ride and the world building was done slowly but purposefully. I honestly really just loved entering this world and escaping into it. Gideon felt like a friend I wanted to hangout with. The other characters while falliable also ended up being favorites. I laughed and cried. When it was done, I immediately wanted to start again and see what I had missed and what clues awaited me. Also, even though this book isn't so much a romance, I still was sailing a ship hard and I loved that feeling. The world created in Gideon the Ninth was so great. If you've been exploring the fantasy genre, don't miss this, it was a joy. I can't wait to read Harrow the Ninth.<br /><br />***SECOND READING***<br />I love the series so much, the writing is fabulous, the plot is incredible. And the reread made me recognize hints and things I missed. I was constantly stopping and saying, \"Oh my god, how did we miss this?!\" Fun experience for sure!"

      "review": "I loved this book, but you probably won’t. See, there is absolutely no way to get an accurate picture of what this book is like by reading the blurb. Anything you are told is actually misleading.<br />- this book is SF, but it’s not hard sci fi, more science fantasy (necromancy is a science and there seems to be some consistency to the rules but most of the terms are technobabble and obviously so)<br />- it features teenagers for the most part but it’s not something I would call YA <br />- it’s about lesbians (or at least bisexual women, the exact preferences are never addressed), but if you come in expecting fan service or even steaminess, you will be sorely disappointed (there is at most some fawning over attractive women)<br />- in my view, there isn’t even much of a romance to speak of<br />- it’s SF and fantasy but it doesn’t have the elaborate world-building I adore and the magic system does not have clear rules and limits (as there would be with Sanderson)<br />- it’s built around a classical detective story whodunnit and looked-room mystery but it’s the Agatha Christie type of mystery, meaning there is no set-up for you to get the clues because you are never given sufficient (much less full) information<br />- there’s action and a plot but it’s more of a mystery than an all-out action plot and there is constant tension instead of sudden build-up.<br />Honestly, by all rights I shouldn’t like it myself. <br /><br />So, what is this book like and why do I even like it? Well, as to the first point: you can imagine the backdrop as Warhammer 40k, if it was more fantasy and military in the sense of medieval knights rather than modern warfare. While this heavily informs the plot, the plot in my view is a detective novel locked-room whodunnit. <br /><br />I’m not entirely sure why I like it, to be honest. That I used 40k as a reference point certainly helped. It set the mood very well for me and I must say read the book with grim anticipation and I received every dark revelation with a squeal of glee. Especially the ones about the emperor and his Lyctors. Lovely! Secondly, I really like Agatha Christie and the puzzle was interesting because the backdrop of necromancy and the intellectual nature of the puzzle was cool. Thirdly, I really really liked all the characters. I can’t stress enough how interesting the entire cast of dramatis personae is. The whole list gets their moment in the limelight and they are fully realized and not at all cliche. The same is true of Gideon herself. Neither her personality nor her backstory are boring. She is at the same time very badass and a very believable inexperienced young adult from a backwater planet (though this is of course subtext since the writing is indirectly form her point of view). <br /><br />I also liked Harrow from the very beginning. I really empathized with her and understood where she was coming from. She is just as much a tragic character as Gideon and neither their lives nor the author are very kind to them.<br /><br />In fact, this is a book filled with suffering and tragedy that manages not to be monotone and dreary and even be quite humorous at times. The most satisfying aspect about the plot is how intimately the mystery ties in with the character development of Harrow and Gideon. The plot pushes them to grow significantly and every moment of personal growth also triggers further plot developments. This was extremely well done. Moreover, ALL of it is show, not tell. You see every moment of growth happening and you witness the plot progress. <br /><br />The only drawback for me was that the writing was too dense with meaning most of the time. You get thrown into this weird world and it takes some time to get adjusted but you will remain back footed throughout the book because Gideon knows nothing about the world and the plot itself forces the characters onto a very steep learning curve. The same is also true of the feelings and motivations of other characters. There’s not much description of tone and facial expression to go on and many times I had to pause and re-read and still could not understand what the author was telling me about a character’s emotion. It was the same feeling I had with Hilary Mantel. And while I am pretty emotionally perceptive, it was still draining and annoying to have to infer reactions and motivations without any information about the character backstory or the world itself and almost no understanding of how their society works and cultural cues. <br /><br />Nevertheless, the author wrote a book that’s exactly my kind of deranged so in the words of the immortal Britney Spears: gimme gimme more!"

      "review": "This book is perhaps the best book I have ever had the privilege of reading. It truly was exceptional in a way so few are—concept, character, world, plot and prose. All fronts were dealt with masterfully. It is clear a lot of time was spent on this book.<br /><br /><br />To start with, I’d like to clear some misconceptions you may have in reading the cover copy:<br /><br />Yes, there are lesbians in this book but it is not a love story in the sense of two characters with sexual chemistry fighting against a world trying to pull them apart. It is about a deep and unbreakable friendship, one that starts so far from cordiality. The romance derives from the emotions that are evoked and the pledges made.<br /><br />Yes, there are bounds of fantasy elements, futuristic nods to a sci-fi setting and intense action sequences that will have you reading until they’re exhausted. But it is first and foremostly a mystery/thriller. There are secrets, agendas and a memorable cast of characters that push and pull and make allegiances and draw lines and do some incredible and terrifying things to get what they want. This is the core of the story, and why it is like nothing I have read before.<br /><br />It is a mystery/thriller dressed up as a sci-fi fantasy. And yet it delivers so beautifully on all fronts—making it all of these things equally at once.<br /><br />The writing is lush and gritty, immersing the reader so deeply into the mind and thoughts of Gideon. Gideon, who is imperfect but full of heart, humour and grit. Gideon who sees people and things and environments through a very particular lense. And we get to see her past as it bubbles up naturally through the surface as the story develops. The characterisation the author was able to imbue was absolutely magnificent thanks to the way the prose was handled.<br /><br />As a reader, I felt deeply connected to the point-of-view character. And that translated into an emotional roller coaster throughout. While plot developments, unveiling of secrets, dynamic action scenes and a well-developed and interesting cast of characters kept me reading late into the night, it was the emotional intimacy that kept me awake and reeling long after I put the book down.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this book highly enough. Even if you are not a fan of sci-fi or fantasy, if you enjoy a thoroughly-worked thriller/mystery in the likes of Silence Of The Lambs or Steven King I bid you give Gideon The Ninth a spin.<br /><br />I have read this book and I will never be the same."

I bet the book/series continues with them moving on from this deep rooted hatred and falling in lust if not love.

Then an opportunity presents itself, and we are rushing into space with Gideon, meeting the aforementioned other important characters, and trying to understand the quicksilver rules of this new situation. Yes, pay attention, but there's so much going on that is probably going to pass you by. See if you can find a friend to read the book at the same time, so you can yell (or text) your questions and ah-ha!s at each other.<br /><br />This was a complicated and confusing world to understand, especially for someone quite unfamiliar with the necromancer construct, but definitely worth sticking with it! There are many many characters, but fortunately the author includes a cast of characters in the front of the book, and a glossary and dossier on the 17 (!) major characters hidden in the back.<br /><br />I didn’t actually love the ending, and it's holding me back a little from ordering book two right now.

There are many trying-to-be-funny lines, but barely any gave me so much as a smile. Positively boring compared to the humor and wit of Terry Pratchett, and not much creative building off of the main plot devices/tropes of having challengers locked in a creepy puzzle house. <br /><br />The worldbuilding seemed promising but is significantly underdeveloped in my opinion, since we have very little insight into how necromancers do anything or the various subspecialties thereof. Lots of fantasy books can get away easily with keeping their supernatural systems totally opaque, but because so much of the story surrounds research and discovery of necromantic theory, I was disappointed that there is almost no necromantic “discovery” other than something which should be obviously predictable to anyone in any world, but I’ll put it behind a spoiler note just in case: <input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"spoiler__control\" aria-label=\"The following text has been marked spoiler.

Some of the primary alternatives that come to mind are Dune (Houses control various planets overseen by a galactic Emperor), various Agatha Christie stories (the Locked Tomb especially), The Hunger Games (government invites challenges to death where characters end up <input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"spoiler__control\" aria-label=\"The following text has been marked spoiler.

I'm not eager to read any of the sequels, but I also wouldn't be shocked if in another year or two I am curious enough to find out what happens next to pick up Harrow the Ninth. For now, there are plenty of other books."

      "review": "Ehh, this felt like a generic adventure reminiscent at times of Ready Player One -- a powerful being apparently leaving bread crumbs with several quests and a promise of glory and immortality at the end. The book follows the adventure of Gideon, bound to serve the Ninth house of the necromancer, as she accompanies her liege/nemesis/frenemy/crush Harrow. Summoned by the big boss to show off their chops, bone witch Harrow taps Gideon as her cavalier, facing off against the other houses.<br /><br />This is about where the story gets away from me, because within a narrow span we are introduced to a bevy of characters from the other houses, with mentions of complex relationships and political intrigue. I didn't have the memory bandwidth for it, and the nuances of the narrative quickly slipped through. The world is also fairly confounding -- are these some sort of humans? Also necromancers? Also space-faring, porn-watching aliens? The story takes another turn more than half-way through and now we have a murder mystery with some queer romance. Picking a lane and sticking to it is not a requirement, but if the author wishes to flutter about, it would be appreciated if the ideas are at least flushed out a little. The one saving grace for me was the character of Gideon herself, with her no-f-given, snarky yet lovable attitude, she manages to carry this Frankenstein of a tale to some extent. Passing on the sequel. "

It's bloody, horrific and action packed with a lot of characters, not all of whom are fully fleshed out so can blend into each other. Gideon is a wonderful MC, full of spirit, one-liners, and a desire to be free and I like the world that has been created though it could do with more thorough world building. Despite the more horror and violent elements this was a fun read and was a great audiobook experience."

Harrow deserves none of Gideon's trust or loyalty but gets it pretty easily, despite her continuing to be mysterious and shady. by the end, i did like Harrow, but i don't buy the 'queer romance' aspect of it all. (romance where?)<br /><br />overall i enjoyed it and got into it very quickly once the story took off, but it did take nearly 200 pages for that to happen so that knocked my enjoyment down a bit. also, i haven't decided if this is a bad thing or just a statement yet but, it is very obvious to<br />me as an ex-Tumblr fandom person that this author spent (and perhaps still spends) A LOT of time on tumblr, in the fandom community specifically. the book had a certain 'written-like-a-fanfiction' quality to it, lmao.<br /><br />i did enjoy this enough to read the next one, but i also checked them out from the library at the same time so i kinda have no choice. onwards!"

      "review": "The first 50 pages were confusing. There were way too many characters introduced right at the beginning. The world was complex, it wasn't obvious how the magic system worked here. The author didn't offer much in terms of explanations and I felt thrown in at the deep end. I was very slowly reading (and re-reading) through the convoluted paragraphs and I sometimes I noticed with surprise that an hour passed by the time I slogged through a single chapter. <br /><br />Yet the pay-off was immense.<br /><br />By the time I reached the 100 page mark I was in love with this world. Every time I reached for the book, I felt myself completely submerged into its reality, and my surroundings completely fell away.<br /><br />The world-building was brilliant. I loved the idea of the Nine Houses with different roles performed for the empire. I loved learning about different types of necromancy. I enjoyed exploring a very special relantionship between necromancer-cavalier pairs. I hope the next books will explore this world much beyond the glimpse that we were allowed here. I'm ready for more.<br /><br />I enjoyed the mystery: both in terms of trying to solve the puzzle of what must be done to ascend to Lyctorhood, and in terms of what the threat looming over the characters was. <input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"spoiler__control\" aria-label=\"The following text has been marked spoiler. Toggle checkbox to reveal or hide.\" onchange=\"this.labels[0].setAttribute('aria-hidden', !this.checked);\" id=\"c6b3fbba-8869-4f4e-94d0-0538b3a20753\" /><label aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"spoiler\" for=\"c6b3fbba-8869-4f4e-94d0-0538b3a20753\">I suspected that Dulcinea wasn't who she claimed to be anyway, so this reveal wasn't shocking. It was the revelation of what becoming a Lyctor involved that I found chilling to the bone. The bond between a necromancer and a cavalier is usually strong and unique. When I try to imagine the emotional strain that the Lyctors must be under after doing what is required, I find it quite understandable that some of them might finally snap.</label><br /><br />And the very, very slow burn romance with hate to love trope done just right... My heart was beating faster every time Gideon and Harrow interacted and I was soaking up with anticipation every miniscule change of dynamics between them. I was rooting for them so hard... They were like fire and water, and yet they were two broken people that were forced to fight together for survival and found out that they have much more in common than they ever cared to learn.<input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"spoiler__control\" aria-label=\"The following text has been marked spoiler.

At some point I wavered in my support for their relationship. Because in the end, wasn't Harrow just cold and abusive? This scene gave me the reason to love both of the characters again, twice as much. We know the hard life that Gideon had from the beginning. But can you imagine what Harrow had to go through, carrying the heavy burden of overwhelming guilt her entire life, and hating herself? In the pool of salty water she admitted her wrongs and put her emotions on the platter. And she was unconditionally accepted. That was poignant, and stunning, and beautiful. <br />And now for my favourite quotation: <i>Gideon did not know how to handle this new, overprotective Harrowhark, this girl with the hunted expression. She kept looking at Gideon with the screwed-up eyes of someone who had been handed an egg for safekeeping and was surrounded by egg-hunting snakes.</i></label><br /><br />Language of the novel might be my only minor complaint. On one hand the author was using complex sentences and unusual words which would pose a challenge to the most advanced non-English speakers. I consider myself 100% fluent, I function in English on everyday basis, and yet I found myself having to look up a word from time to time. On the other hand, some vulgarisms and slangish expressions were sprinkled over the pages, which threw me off my rhythm every time. I found this contrast a bit inconsistent.<br /><br />And now let me say a few words about the ending. <input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"spoiler__control\" aria-label=\"The following text has been marked spoiler. Toggle checkbox to reveal or hide.\" onchange=\"this.labels[0].setAttribute('aria-hidden', !this.checked);\" id=\"c67ce892-5010-4be8-948d-3de4377bfeb3\" /><label aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"spoiler\" for=\"c67ce892-5010-4be8-948d-3de4377bfeb3\">This novel took my heart, made it beat faster and faster with anticipation. It made it fill with love for the characters. For Gideon and Harrowhark. For Palamedes and Camilla. For Magnus and Abigail. And then it squeezed it, pierced it with sharp bones and threw it down an abyss. The ending was heart-breaking and unfair for any of the characters I grew to love, and I didn't even have enough strength left to cry. I just felt suddenly empty and numb. But at the same time, this ending was glorious.</label><br /><br />I don't know how I'm going to manage having to wait over six months for the sequel..."

      "review": "This book was a ton of fun. I was a bit worried about reading it because it's been so hyped that I thought it surely couldn't be as good as everyone said! But it was truly enjoyable.<br /><br />It's basically a science fiction locked-room mystery set in a haunted house on a deserted planet, with necromancers both as suspects and as victims. I enjoyed the cast of characters. Per the book's title, there are nine necromantic Houses in this universe, with the Ninth being a quasi-legitimate house with the task of guarding the Tomb Which Can Never Be Opened. This makes them possibly the most creepy of all the necromancers, which isn't an easy contest to win. The Ninth House wears long black robes, paints their faces at all times to look like skulls, and specializes in bone necromancy.<br /><br />Gideon, a foundling who grew up in the Ninth because her mother crash-landed and died there, hates it. A lot. She just wants to leave and join the space army and meet other people and have some glorious mayhem. She's been thwarted in that desire all her life, but because her House is summoned to aforementioned haunted house on deserted planet, she is tasked with being the House Cavalier, essentially a bodyguard to the head of the House, Harrowhark. She and Harrow hate each other dearly, but a chance is a chance, and off they go together.<br /><br />Cue the haunted house adventure. There are tasks to be completed, keys to be gathered, a puzzle to be solved. Honestly, the whole plot is pretty much a red herring that has almost nothing to do with the denouement except to give the reader some ideas of what a Lyctor (the prize for solving the puzzle is becoming a Lyctor) might be. That's fine, though, for the characters were amusing and interesting, the interpersonal drama was the sort that I find fun, and I quickly found my favorite characters and rooted for them.<br /><br />A note on romance: I don't see this as a romance between Gideon and Harrow. Gideon does like girls, and it's never really clear what Harrow likes, at least in this book. But if it's a romance, it's the medieval definition of romance. What do I mean? Here are the characteristics of a medieval romance:<br />1. an idealization of chivalry<br />2. an idealization of the hero/knight and his noble deeds<br />3. a knight’s love for a lady<br />4. imaginary or vague settings<br />5. mystery and suspense / supernatural elements<br />6. a concealed or disguised identity<br />7. repetition of the mystic number 3 or multiples of 3.<br /><br />As you can see, it's pretty much all there. And to be clear, the knight's love for his lady manifests as service and sacrifice. Medieval romances were essentially propaganda intended to give knights a reason for subservience to the women who were left in charge of estates when their husbands were off at war or at court. They were generally not consummated but considered to be a pure love without sex coming into the mix (because the lord of the manor would be quite annoyed to come home from war to find out that his vassals had been getting it on with his wife). This seems more like Gideon and Harrow to me. So I know that quite a few folks ship Harrow and Gideon, but I don't think the story is intended to go that way. I could be wrong!<br /><br />Anyway, the book managed to be both funny and tragic. It's also quite impressively constructed. Kudos to the author!"

      "review": "So where to begin. I am a fan of all things teen fiction and this novel fits more in the teen angsty mystery category than true hard science fiction. This is set in some far distant dystopian future where our descendants have split into planetary casts filled with bones and stilted actions. <br />If I were to judge this by adult fiction standards it’s maybe a passible three star book. The world is vague, shrouded in rust and mist but never fully explained. That is OK IF the characters were unique and interesting. I also saw both the bad guy and and predictable ending a mile away which means I spent a good half the book going “come ON guys. Stop and think!” <br /><br />Now in a teen novel, I’m ok with not fully realized worlds and more simplistic (whiny) characters in favor of a bloody who dunit and basic romance. I would still love to see real LGTB romance but Gideon was definitely gay and there was a spark between two of the MCs, just not much of one and then there was the whole Shakespearean tragedy angle. <br /><br />I feel the novel starts off in one direction with our stubborn Gideon, unwilling recruit to the Ninth House necromancers. The whole planet is either a cave system, or some decaying cloister where animated dead bodies rule from the grave. Then she gets shanghaied into a Cavalier (sort of weird Romantic dualist) in space to her arch nemesis Harrow. (Introduction in the book made her out to be Gideon’s superior and older so oops the image of a skinny matron stuck in my head and might have interfered with later plot development)<br /><br />Once on a mouldering plant that first seems all ruins, then there are intact libraries, a submarine like dungeon? bone servants, a Teacher , and cliffs “of insanity” (sorry when someone threatened to toss Gideon off a cliff my first thought was “what cliff and where did that come from”) because very little is grounded in relation to each other. scenes appear in the story rather like vignettes. Little shadow boxes with actors and actions inside but unconnected to anything else in the novel. I never understood the keys, the point of the mystery, Teacher, the Houses, the Emperor. Why 9th house had cold food on their planet and lived on top of bone dust. Why the rules were so easy to circumvent... so many questions.<br /><br />Now the story picked up towards the last third, almost as if the author Finally decided what the novel would be about. Action tightened up, characters were interesting. I Still didn’t get how things fit together on the planet but at least it was less endless monologue and more doing.<br /><br />I am sadly Not going to buy Harrow the ninth. I have too many Sci Fi in my TBR pile for more of this. It’s entertaining. Has female Lead who Isn’t an all powerful being. I just wish the story could have solidified a little earlier in the novel."

      "review": "Star rating: 4.5 | <br /><br />Gideon Nav would do anything to get off world, they say be careful what you wish for, and Gideon might just have to pay the highest price for getting what she wants……<br /><br />Gideon is an orphan. She is the daughter of a criminal who died in mysterious circumstances. As a result she grew up in the care of the ninth house - one of the nine houses in a empire of the same name - and now to pay off the debt of her upbringing Gideon must serve the ninth and her childhood enemy, Harrowhark. <br /><br />In the service of the ninth, Gideon’s life is miserable. She’s has tried multiple time to escape, but every time she has failed. So when Harrow puts a proposal to Gideon that would guarantee Gideon her freedom, she could not say no. All she has to do is act as Harrows right hand - cavalier primary - as she is summoned to the first house to take part in a challenge with the other houses….. simple right? But things are never as easy as they seem! <br /><br />I am late to the party on this book, but this is a fantastic debut. While I have seen this book included on lists of recommendations for sapphic fantasy romance, this is not really accurate. I mean don’t get me wrong, the potential for an enemy’s to friends to lovers storyline is definitely there over the course of the rest of the trilogy, but that would mean Gideon making a dramatic return from the dead. Which to be fair is what I hope happens In terms of just the first book though, it gives me more of a series one of merlin vibe (old Merthur shipper here, sorry not sorry) where you can see the potential for Romance but there are definitely things they need to work through first. <br /><br />That is not to say the characters sexualities are sidelined or ignored. I love the way the characters are portrayed. Gideon - who is a total bad ass in every other area of life - forgets how to function around a girl she likes. This fact had me absolutely howling with laughter by the way. <br /><br />Harrow has her own storyline which focuses on what she found inside the locked tomb - the thing the ninth house is meant to guard - which has great potential for loyalty testing in future books. Not just the obvious one concerning her new role as lyctor to the Emperor. BUT also if Gideon does indeed make her spectacular return and is threatened by the resident of the tomb, what will Harrow do!?? <br /><br />Harrow and Gideon are surrounded by a well thought out cast of supporting characters - shout out to Dulcinea - and seeing how they approach the challenge in different ways was really fun to watch. However the section where we are introduced to these characters seem confused and you end up scratching your head trying to figure out who is who? 🤔<br /><br />In fact the entire section of the book where we are introduced to the challenge is hard to get through. If you are not trying to figure out who is who, Gideon is just wandering around Caanon house on her own, not really doing much. <br /><br />That being said the second half of this book really picks up the pace. Things are not right in Caanon house and the houses need to figure out what is happening. We also learn more about why Gideon and Harrow grew up as enemies, and to see them work through that is beautiful and brought a tear to my eye.<br /><br />Overall the quote on the cover of this book is very accurate is it indeed “lesbian necromancers exploring a haunted gothic palace in space” and why would not want to read that???? <br /><br />“I’ve lived my whole life at your mercy, yours alone. And god knows I deserve to die at your hand. You are my only friend. I am undone without you.”"

      "review": "Listen.<br /><br />I went into this knowing it would be a wild ride, and it was one of the best rides of my life. This series has just shot up to the highest tiers of my “Top Faves” shelf.<br /><br />Although the book is heavily advertised as “space lesbians with bone magic”, it’s SO much more than that. Reducing the book(s) to just that is a bit of a disservice IMO. <br /><br />The setting is definitely sci-fi, there’s lots of fascinating necromantic shenanigans, and there sure is some palpable sapphic tension throughout the book, but there isn’t any overt romance. I found this to be delightfully refreshing; I’ve been craving queer stories where the whole book doesn’t revolve solely on the characters’ queerness and love triangles. Gideon Nav is sapphic without a doubt, and several of the other characters are hella queer too, but that’s not the main focus of this story. <br /><br />In fact, I’d say the main focus is a story of discovery and healing, but also trauma and loss. <br /><br />And I have never related to a protagonist more than I relate to Gideon Nav. Meme Lord Supreme. Certified Beefcake. Most of all, a protagonist that has been severely mistreated and abused in every conceivable way, but still chooses to be kind, to care about others even when some of them were the arbiters of the trauma and cruelty in her life. To be able to forgive and to move on because people change and grow, and sometimes all anyone needs is a genuine apology and real acknowledgement of how terrible one has behaved. <br /><br />Like, wow.<br /><br />11/10, gimme more bones, gimme more muscle-buff memelord swordswomen. <br />👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻"

      "review": "I did not read the synopsis of the book, but Tor.com had put out articles on this so many times which I avoided to read, and also the cover is awesome, so obviously I picked this book as one of my pandemic quarantine readings. I like the book and have decided to continue with the series.<br /><br />This book is a fantasy story (necromancy), combined with a little horror and mystery, and some detailed explanations (or maybe they are vague to me, because the theorems or whatever just go over my head) on necromancy technology thrown in. The story is fast-paced after some slow introduction to the Canaan House, and it kept twitching to unexpected direction, made me constantly changing assumptions of who's actually responsible for the whole murders in the Canaan House, where all the representative necromancers and cavaliers from the 9 Houses assembled to become Lyctors.<br /><br />The worldbuilding is original, but unfortunately not explained in detail, maybe because the author has several books in mind. The readers understand it by experiencing the story, which I like. But I still think my comprehension of their world is sketchy: What are the primary skill of each house? Who is the Emperor Undying, and why is he undead? Why does he needs so many Lyctors and what for? Why he has to wait so long to replenish his Lyctor numbers? What happened long time ago that led to the deep hate in his Lyctors' hearts? So many revelations are expected in the next books of the series: Harrow the Ninth (will be published in August 2020), and Alecto the Ninth.<br /><br />Now let's talk about Gideon Nav, the redhead \"cavalier primary\" from the Ninth House, the protagonist: I like her loud and hilarious sarcasms (bordering to annoying, almost reminding me to the loudmouth protagonists in Andy Weir books), along with her soft heart for anything beautiful or skillful. I like her badass fighting skills (she did not even use her usual double longswords in this book) and her hate/hate/love-hate relationship with her necromancer, Harrowhark Nonagesimus. I like her righteousness and her decisiveness. But I do think she did not have time to show her full potential in this book *sigh. <br /><br />Her necromancer, Harrow, on the other side, keep progressing to be even better than her parents and grandparents. She has to, her name is on the second book cover, so at least we know that she did not die (or if she died, she came back in one piece). Also badass and violent in a cold way, I admire this studious and talented character, and she stopped at nothing to get her way. Eagerly wait to see what she'll become in Book 2.<br /><br />Other characters are originally interesting, too, each with their own unique quirkiness. But, ah, the ending, the ending! <br /><br />The book is advertised quoting Charles Stross: “Lesbian necromancers explore a haunted gothic palace in space!\" but there is really no lesbian story in it. There is some feeble attempt here and there, but no romance scenes, which is good. I have read quite a lot of good fantasy books with meh love stories, that I think those books will be better without them."

But either you get used to it or she does this less. I was also really confused with what was going on. The world and society wasn’t explained that well or at all, maybe it’s to add to the spooky mystery vibe?<br />\t<br />The tagline on the front of the book was quite misleading, after reading : “Lesbian necromancers explore a haunted gothic place in space” I could be forgiven for thinking it would be a big Lesbian necromancer romance story when actually there is very little to no romance at all. The main character is attracted to girls (but not a necromancer) but its really just her commenting on how hot the other women are. It was nice to see a fantasy character who does just lust after/fancy other characters rather than having to have an undying love affair, but the expectation was put into my mind and I kept finding myself waiting for the love story to happen.<br /><br />Gideon is one of my favourite leading ladies. Definitely not your normal character and she stands out among all the other strong leading ladies of books I’ve read. Shes sassy and headstrong and at times really comical. Theres a great range of other characters in the book, lots of people to love and root for and some to hate! <br /> <br />Overall the storyline is extremely unique, the plot is great and it actually reminded me of these old Computer games my parents used to play (7th guest, 11th hour etc, where you go into rooms and have to work out the puzzle and the reason you’re actually there!) and I really enjoyed it!

It lives in my head rent free because I am not a shit landlord. Great characters, funny lesbian MC, all the women are sexy, great plot, great writing. It's in your face gay and homoerotic without being explicit (I would die). Also as a gray romantic lesbian, I LOVED the romance. It felt so natural to me. It was underscored and then became prominent enough that it couldn't be ignored, ya know? The author said this book was romantic but did not necessarily have romance (is she trying to conceal the series end?? god if I know) and I ATE THAT SHIT UP. Peak romance to me, not looking for romance but accidentally being in thick of it(ah fuck (&gt;;3)). And the characters revealing the worst parts of themselves to each other but still supporting each other???? If that's not love then it doesn't exist. Just fuck, what a series. It irrevocably rewrote my brain chemistry and forever altered any prose I write (just look at this review)"

Well, hold that thought.<br /><br />My main problem with this book is the writing style. There’s no dialog. Just endless descriptions that felt like they were leading me on a merry-go-round to nowhere. <br /><br />The worldbuilding is very very poor. There’s this 9th planet where there’s a tomb. People from this planet guard this tomb. The emperor requests one representative and their cavalier to go and try to become a Lyctor. None of this is really explained. What is in the tomb? Why did the emperor need a house dedicated to war? None. It's like the author dangles these cool concepts in front of us but never really dives in. <br /><br />Gideon wants to go out of the planet, and escape. And the Reverend daughter tells her the only way Gideon is leaving is to go as her cavalier. The plot's supposed to revolve around this intense competition to become a Lyctor, but even halfway through, I was lost about who's who and what's what. The houses, their roles, all a blur.<br /><br />The pacing is all over the place. The part 1 felt meaningless, part 2 boring, part 3 things start picking up, part 4 nothing makes sense. First 30% they don’t work together and the first 50% she’s in this vow of silence. It’s boring. So so boring. It’s supposed to be a mystery. There’s no tension. No tension between who is killing everybody, and what are they supposed to be doing there, no tension in the romance.<br /><br />I’m so disappointed. I wanted to love this book, because necromancers and lesbians sounds awesome but I couldn’t bring myself to keep reading it. I think it tries to be this dark, poetic, edgy book but fails at everything. It’s a confusing snooze-fest for me."

      "review": "<i>Gideon the Ninth</i> is the name and affiliation of the main character in the novel, since she is a member of the Ninth House. The novel begins with her attempt to escape the slavery which she has lived under for the entire nineteen years of her life. Through the evil manipulation of her mistress, Harrow the Ninth, she is thwarted and ends up travelling to the First House, the house of the King, with Harrow for a meeting with members of the other houses. The resulting conclave is a locked room, Agatha Christie-like murder mystery, except that half the guests are necromancers and the other half, like Gideon, are their sword-carrying body guards. As you can imagine with a group of necromancers in attendance, the murders are particularly gruesome and hard to unravel.<br /><br /><i>Gideon the Ninth</i> is fun to read. There is humor in the repartee between Gideon and Harrow and in the slang that Gideon uses. She has a sharp wit and is free with her sarcasm. She is, afterall, nineteen years old. It is also a murder mystery and holds the reader's attention for that reason, too.<br /><br />There is a well-written, exciting fight scene at the climax of the book. Some of the dialog helps the reader to understand the characters' motives, but they are still a bit unlcear, and remain so when the book is finished. This may be part of the style of \"Gideon\", since it is a mystery throughout, but that shouldn't stop the author from making the characters understandable in the end. Not understanding the characters, makes it impossible to really understand the plot. And, of course, it's easier to empathize with the characters, if you understand them.<br /><br /><i>Gideon the Ninth</i> is sometimes billed as science fiction, but despite FTL travel and human colonies on many planets, there are no ray guns or even old-fashioned \"slug throwers\"; just sharpened steel and leather gauntlets—and necromancers! Lots of them. And, they're the good guys, and the bad guys and all the guys in between. <i>Gideon the Ninth</i> is future fantasy and the advanced science plays no meaningful part in the story.<br /><br />If you look up \"Gideon\" in a library catalogue, you will see that among the listed subjects is \"Lesbian Fiction\". Indeed, at the time of this review (March 2021), it was listed by Amazon as #2 in LGBTQ + Science Fiction (Kindle Store), #8 in Lesbian Romance, #10 in LGBTQ + Fantasy (Kindle Store). That isn't true, or at least, it shouldn't be. The lesbian theme is not very noticeable or important to the plot. It wasn't glaring or \"edgy\", because it was simply part of the fabric of the story. That's as it should be. Afterall, unless the author has an axe to grind, 'unnoticeable' is perhaps the best reception a reader can give such a theme, since it suggests that non-traditional relationships are becoming \"normal\".<br /><br />In case you are reading this review and didn't already know, this is the first in a proposed trilogy. The second novel is <i>Harrow the Ninth</i> (2020), and the third will be <i>Alecto the Ninth</i>. Knowing this, you will not be surprised that Harrow survives the ordeal at First House, to be the main character in the second novel. Guess what's next on my list."

      "review": "It was a book I wanted to like but I couldn't.<br />Quick plus very well balanced gender roles and very well done keeping any gender influence out of the society.<br /><br />The prose was ok but a bit awkward at times. The word choice was was fairly limited and the same words repeated over and over again and word selection felt very limited (like this was a YA author who decided to write adult fiction and did it with a few thesaurus words). For a book screamed it was about \"lesbian necromancers\" I spent the whole time reading into when they would through romance into it. That made the read worse. Then in the end there was one line about having had the \"hots\" for another character, it is just amazing what the publishers will push now. There was NO romance in the book and I'd have enjoyed it more if I hadn't not gone in ready to do eye rolling when it came up. If they left any hints of romance off the blurb it would have been easier to enjoy and not try to read into every interaction.<br /><br />The first 1/4 of the book was hard to get through. Then during the middle I had places I raced through and other places I hit a wall of wanting it to be over. Then the ending happened? I think it happened? It just petered out and I'm not sure what I had read. I don't think there was any story arc in the end...The friendship / respect arc that was the whole story didn't work. Well I'm being to ramble like this book so I will end it here."

      "review": "To see more reviews check out <a href=\"https://mibookreviews.wordpress.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">MI Book Reviews</a>.<br /><br />To quote my response to my favorite library who put this book in my hands, “Fuck. This is almost as intense as the mermaids. I need a fluffy romance cleanser now”. There is also the recommendation I sent to my zucchini, “You need to read this. Fuck. Just holy fuck”. I will attempt to explain myself, but honestly, I am still pretty much stuck at those reviews.<br /><br />This book was sold to me with two words: lesbian necromancers. That was all I needed. I didn’t need a plot. I didn’t need a cover. I just needed those two words. They have also worked on other people. So I will use them here too: LESBIAN NECROMANCERS.<br /><br />Ok, now on to the actual book. It was beautifully written. Gideon was the narrator and she had a really distinct voice. She was goofy and fun. She was a bit bitter, had lots of guilt, and really needs someone to look out for her. She is so flawed and so perfect. I love Gideon. I want her to be happy. I shipped her with so many people, but of course, all of them dealt with dead bodies. I shipped her with her necromancer, with another necromancer that I can’t spell her name (but when you read it, you will see), and Jack from Every Heart a Doorway.<br /><br />Despite my constant shipping, the book was not romantic. There were some threads of romance, but so very faint. There were more threads of connection and family. There were so many twists and turns. There was so much that happened. I was blindsided. I was reading what was feeling like an enemies to lovers queer romance, but then BAM murders. Not just ordinary murders, but really gory and horrifying murders that only a supernatural force could cause. I can’t stand murder plots, but maybe I need to amend that statement to be: I can’t stand murder plots, unless they involve excessive gore and necromancers.<br /><br />The book is the first in a series, but do not read the second description. It will have a big spoiler on the ending. It will not ruin any of the drama, but it will take some of the twists and turns away.<br /><br />I am going to go back to being just amazed. I need the second book now. I feel a bit lost without Gideon in my hands."

      "review": "This book has ruined me for other books—I hope not forever.<br /><br />This is how it goes:<br />You hear a couple friends recommend this book. And then a couple mutuals online. And then some complete strangers who are making pretty art or funny jokes that turn out to be based on this series. “Lesbian necromancers in space!” they all tell you, laughing, as if that alone is a good reason to read and not just a collection of words pulled from a hat. For some folks, that is reason enough—Lord knows there’s a dearth of queer fantasy books the get popular enough to hit the mainstream.<br /><br />So you finally decide to pick it up, or at least place it on hold at your local library. And when it’s your turn, you’re skeptical. Honestly, the writing comes off as a bit pretentious, like the author got paid extra to stick in a few more SAT words. “Overrated,” flashes through your smug mind, but you keep going. Eventually, you reach the mystery element. Now there’s a puzzle to be solved beyond just trying to understand the word building, and you’re getting uniquely frustrated at the point of view character. Every time it looks like a secret might slip, she switches focus! But you’re determined to find out what’s happening.<br /><br />You keep reading. You start cheering for the ninth house and sixth house. Layers of these characters are being peeled back slowly. You cling to every interaction between Gideon and Harrow, even though you dutifully hated Harrow at Gideon’s request at the beginning. You’re still confused but invested. And then it ends.<br /><br />And dammit, there’s still so many things that didn’t make sense! So I guess you have to read the next one and the one after that and the one after that (if it ever comes out) as well as the hand full of short stories. The confusion will last until at least half way into Book 3, with bits of clarity interspersed amongst the rest. And then you will read this first book two more times, and each time the ending devastates you in a new way. Because this series offers re-readability like you wouldn’t believe. You can really chew on every detail, theorize, and obsess to your heart���s content.<br /><br />I don’t want to overhype this book—that’s how you make everyone skeptical to read it—but it did affect me in ways I couldn’t have predicted. I’m sure the humor and combination of horror and shonen anime tropes won’t be for everyone. The language and world building are dense and may put off those unwilling to believe it could be not only worth it but necessary for the picture being painted. This author loves to hide important details in plain sight through layers of dual meanings. If you don’t enjoying wrestling with a book, this might not be for you. Gideon the Ninth asks you to participate. It will not hand you everything neatly presented; you must pick up a sword and prepare to battle bone constructs and unknown motives alongside Gideon. And if this book asks too much, Harrow the Ninth will be right out for you. <br /><br />This book is a fun read alone and completely devastating in conjunction with the rest of the Locked Tomb series. Five out of five stars."

      "review": "This was really surprising. There are some good ideas in here, but the problem is there are TOO MANY ideas. This feels like a lot of things smushed together, but at the same time, there is a huge lull in the middle where little happens. It's a book of wild plot and tone shifts and it didn't quite work for me. <br /><br />The premise is really cool, but it's not really what is advertised. The \"in space\" bit is just a couple of dull pages on a spaceship in transit. The characters are all from different planets, but 10%-ish of the book is on the Ninth planet and the rest is all inside a giant mansion. We are also promised lesbians, but other than admiring some legs and a bit of handholding, the \"romantic\" bits are vague and queer-batey as hell, and could all easily be read as friendship (in a 1950's, Hayes Code kind of way. The same way it's hard to tell that Audrey Hepburn is actually a sex worker in 'Breakfast at Tiffany's'.) My partner said that the romance in here, quote: \"Makes 'The Age of Innocence' look like 'Fifty Shades of Grey'.\"<br /><br />Necromancy is neat, but most of the book is just Gideon walking around the house and listening to other people talk about interesting stuff. Gideon is one of the least complex characters. She knows nothing about what is happening and has little to no necromancer knowledge and no magic. Usually, when we follow a character like this, they are a portal, an audience substitute, into the world. They know nothing, so everyone has to explain stuff to them, and thereby explain to us, the reader. That doesn't happen here. Gideon spends much of the story mute, and when she finally starts asking people to explain, they tend to ignore her. She doesn't understand, so we barely understand. Everyone else is running around, spying, collecting info, trying to get ahead, doing cool magic shit, but we follow Gideon to uneventful meals in the dining room where she describes soup. The last 10% of the ebook after the story ended was literally reference material about necromancy that I didn't know existed until I was done reading. Don't need it now, thanks. I was just lost in a lack of in-story worldbuilding.<br /><br />The language is also all over the place. Some of it is flowery, religious, emo poems about death. Some of it is peppered with SAT words, like \"coruscating\" or \"avulsion\". Some of the writing is just everyday, basic, anybook stuff... and some of it is modern, sarcastic teen. Gideon is always saying things like \"stick it your ass\" or \"that's what she said\". You could get whiplash from the tone changes. <br /><br />I liked the book at the start (I like sassy teen) but as it kept going, I liked it less and less. The plot kept shifting into new and unexpected gears. It was wild! Also, I didn't understand much of the magic system until the end. You can't finally define exactly what Harrow's powers are 75% of the way through the book, while at the same time telling me that what she is CURRENTLY doing is something new and exciting and badass. It has no stakes. I didn't know what the rules even were, so I am in no way dazzled that she is breaking them now. Also, I didn't like Harrow. There are reviews claiming that Gideon is the bad character and that she is \"whiny\". Those people are insane. Gideon was constantly abused, physically and emotionally, for her whole life. She is not a free person. She still manages to show more humanity and kindness than most of the other characters. She's been through a lot. She's allowed to say \"fuck it\", ok?<br /><br />By the end, it felt like I was reading a fanfic based on the 'Dark Souls' videogame franchise. I couldn't picture what was being described, and I like 'Dark Souls'.... so I just imagined 'Dark Souls' bossfights. <br /><br />It's different, and if I was a teen I might be more into it. I finished this book, and I don't plan to continue."

      "review": "4.5 stars. <br /><br />Usually I'm more of a classic sci-fi/fantasy reader but nevertheless, this book caught my attention, and I listened to it as an audiobook. Overall, I enjoyed it a lot, even though it wasn't quite what I expected. If you're looking for some modern fantasy that sets itself apart from the chaff, this is an excellent choice. Also, no spoilers, but the author has serious balls to go through with the ending that they wrote as they are planning on writing a trilogy. <br /><br />Now, there are several misconceptions or ideas that I got about this book from reviews before I read it. I'll try to give people who haven't read this book yet a disclaimer on some of the other reviews:<br /><br />- LGBT stuff: Judging by the tags, categorizations, and other reviews about this book, I was expecting faaaaar more romance, or, (sorry if this comes out wrong) \"lgbt-ness\". Personally, I wouldn't categorize this novel as \"lgbt\" just how I wouldn't categorize a novel as \"straight\". The extent of \"lgbt\" that happens in this novel is just that some characters aren't straight. That's it. There is absolutely no moral preaching or anything and the fact that the main character is gay/bi(?) is a complete non-topic to all the other characters. Being lgbt, discovering one's sexuality, coming out, or any of the other common lgbt-themes are not present in this story and as such, I think it's being mislabeled by some of the other reviews.<br /><br />- (White) Necromancy: When I see descriptions like \"dark\",\"gritty\", and \"necromancers\", I typically think of evil cults, blood sacrifices, and doing horrible experiments on the human soul. Most necromancers in this book aren't like that at all (and that's not a bad thing) which wasn't what I was expecting. The protagonist and her ilk, who are the \"good guys\", are rather good people by what I'd expect from necromancers. All the necromancers, except the villains obviously, are either white or light-gray in their morality, and abhor traditional necromancer staples like human sacrifice, murder, or enslaving souls. Seeing all the friendly necromancers was not what I expected, but overall I think it made the story better. <br /><br />Now, finally, my only real complaint about the story (extremely minor spoilers):<br /><br />The world building was a bit wonky. Space travel exists, along with all it's accoutrements such as shuttle craft, space stations, and battleships. That said, spaceships are only really used to get from one setting to another or as a general background footnote. Furthermore, technology is all over the place. Characters are well versed in everything from human-skin bound books to tablet computers and frequently interact with both candles and motion activated LED spotlights. They also use swords and other simple martial weapons to fight even though automatic rifles and presumably other more advanced weapons exist. Even more confusingly, there seems to be lots of advanced environmental control technology and machinery which \"just works\" and none of the characters really have any clue about. Besides the technology questions, the Empire is always fighting a mysterious foe who is never explained and the protagonist gets modern comics delivered to her shadow-cultist home? Maybe this is all on purpose, but I found the world building to create more and more questions to build up as the book progressed and they're never answered. Maybe that's for the sequel?"

There's a high-stakes sci-fantasy grand plot wrapped up in a neat locked-room mystery. There's a hysterically funny teen protagonist who loves her sword so much she wants to marry it. There's a cast of loveable weirdos. There's Illiad references and meme references and Bible jokes at a key point in the series someone makes a \"none pizza left beef\" joke. There's Childhood Friends to Enemies to A Bond of Guilt and Loyalty and Shared Pain and Repressed Sexual Attraction and Maybe Even Something Transcending Romance (to Lovers!? TBC). There's something for everyone in Gideon. There's an Extra Special Bonus if you've been waiting your whole damn life for a casually queer MC in a casually queer setting.

It wasn't until Gideon and Harrow had made it to the planet of the First that I really started to read the book, and I didn't put it down for three (maybe four) days straight until I had finished the entire book. Granted, I saw the ending coming about three quarters into the book, but that didn't make the read any less interesting.<br />To other LGBTQ readers, this isn't a romance novel in the stereotypical sense, but something much more convoluted. There is queer love but not in a yearning way, more of finding love for someone as you slowly start to discover who someone really is inside, despite internal prejudices.<br />A fantasy, mystery, and sci-fi rolled into one, accompanied with sword fighting cavaliers, an enemies to something more, and necromancers at every turn."

      "review": "I love a book that just drops me into action with no explanation. At times I felt like I did, in fact, need explanation bc this book is a lot of moving parts and there are a lot of characters and sometimes the way they get referred to utterly confused me and I had to go back through the dialogue and check who was speaking (never did I have to check when it was Gideon referring to Harrow as “her necromancer”, though, bc I’m a queer and I Get It). But, I just kind of ignored that and plowed on through bc the story and characters were compelling enough that most of the time it didn’t matter that I had no idea what was happening. About halfway through, I had that moment of understanding I was never going to read this book for the first time again, and got upset. <br /><br />After that, I was utterly distraught to learn my hunch about the ending was correct, and I have finally, after so long, found a big queer not-relationship that felt organic, and without that brow-beating YA slant of having to point out that they’re queer and that it makes them interesting. Gideon’s queerness doesn’t make her interesting, her terrible and wonderful personality makes her interesting and that’s what this book is about!! I love her and even more deeply I love Harrowhark, who is an abhorrent person and immediately the one I pointed to and was like yes, Her. Their relationship, or the undercurrent of it, was just meant to be accepted and that, really, is all I want. You don’t have to adorn your queers in a big neon sign and have them profess their teen love for each other, all you have to do is have them expose their darkest secrets in a big pool and then make them hold hands. That’s romance!<br /><br />The only reason I don’t feel like this book is perfect is bc I think sometimes it gets bogged down in the minutiae of worldbuilding rather than giving an easy, big picture. I don’t need pages of exposition but occasionally just spelling things out to me is super fine. I am very stupid, and sometimes I really just wanted a little bit of “this is, in the world, where these things are situated and what they look like as a whole”. As it stands, that’s how I kept floundering in some parts and just had to ignore and plow through."

      "review": "(ill finish this review tomorrow -- i had a ton of motivation to start writing book review this afternoon haha)<br /><br />TL;DR -- GtN has glaring issues with pacing and a sometimes convoluted plot. However, the humor, world-building, and genre-bending vision was executed well enough for me to excuse some of the book's technical issues. <br /><br />What I disliked:<br />1. Pacing -- The exposition was 150 pages too long, and the climax was far too short. Nothing of note happens in the first quarter of the book, and it's filled to the brim with a bunch of unneccesary expository details. Instead of making me interested in the book's world (which I assume was the intention), it left me overwhelmed with minutia and made it more difficult to understand the book later on, since important details were lost in all the frivolous trivia. Then, in the last quarter of the book, the plot moves at light speed; it honestly feels like 70% of the plot's development happened in the last 200 pages or so. It gave me whiplash as a reader to go from wading through a sea of trivia to suddenly having to read each page carefully as not to miss a massively important plot point. If the exposition was cut to around 75 pages, and the climax extended by about 100 pages, this book would've been near a 10/10 for me. <br /><br />2. Narration -- IMO, narratives told strictly linearly can be boring, especially in fantasy. On the flip side, narration that is excessively confusing and hard to follow can get on my nerves. There are moments in this book where the narration crosses that threshold and becomes convoluted. What gets me the most is that crucial elements of the world and plot are never explicitly explained in the book. What is thanergy/thalergy? What was the Resurrection? What is the cohort, actually? Who is the King Undying? What is the social/political structure of the houses? The basics of the plot are fairly easy to understand, but if you want a more robust understanding of what is going on at all times in the book, it honestly feels like you need a PhD. <br /><br /><br />What I liked: <br />1. Humor -- I hate when fantasy books take themselves too seriously, and I felt like the sarcastic narration kept GtN grounded and self-aware. There was not a chapter in this book without a killer joke, and that not only kept the narrative more light-hearted but it was also a very effective way to break up some of the more plot-heavy parts of the book. It's also just funny, yall. I spent a lot of time on Tumblr as a kid, so this style of humor is right up my alley ngl. <br /><br />2. World-building -- To be straight with yall: this author is mad creative and flips convention in fantasy and sci-fi books. The world that this book takes place in is nothing like I've ever read before, and its incredibly compelling. Part of what made the extra-long exposition manageable is the fact that the world was interesting enough to keep me hooked, even when I was reading about random jack shit in the ninth lol. I love the weird gothic cult of skeletons. I love the abandoned castle with spaceship ports. I love the magic military of necromancers. I love the eltrich horror skeleton creations lurking in a modern-day laboratory. I love to see fantasy writers now rejecting some of the classic tropes and allowing themselves to get really creative with their worlds. <br /><br />3. Vision -- <br /><br />4. Characters -- The two main characters Harrow and Gideon are case studies in peak character development. They change subtlely but profoundly throughout the course of the story. As you learn more about their backgrounds, you begin to understand them and their motivations <br /><br /><br />Misc:<br />I could write a thesis on Harrow and Gideon's weird co-dependent hate/love relationship.

Still teared up during The Scenes. I appreciate Cytherea more on every reread, she's terrible and the best. T-minus 9 days til Nona!<br /><br />[first reread review]<br />Just as amazing on a reread! Even knowing all the surprises and twists, I was still excited to get to each one. And hearing all the epic lines read aloud? Incredible. The narrator was perfect, doing exactly the right inflection for everything, and doing unique voices for every character while not being too silly. I can't express how much I adore this book. <br /><br />[original review]<br />I have the absolutely wonderful feeling of when I've just finished reading a book I really really enjoyed and my heart is like...tight with excitement. Ultimate satisfaction combined with frustration of there not being any more book to read. <br /><br />The fact that this is one of my favorite books of the year is actually a surprise! When I first started the book, I was a little put off by the writing style. I didn't quite understand what was going on. But I quickly got SO INTO IT. <br /><br />The book just checks a lot of boxes for me. Fun, snarky characters that kind of all hate each other, but they also work together and some of them secretly like each other a lot. A plot that revolves around a trial sort of set up, different challenges and teams racing for something. A murder mystery? A couple of murder mysteries? A really really good enemies-to-lovers(?) plot that is so unsatisfying and satisfying at the same time with quotes like this:<br /><br />“I have tried to dismantle you, Gideon Nav! The Ninth House poisoned you, we trod you underfoot—I took you to this killing field as my slave—you refuse to die, and you pity me! Strike me down. You’ve won. I’ve lived my whole wretched life at your mercy, yours alone, and God knows I deserve to die at your hand. You are my only friend. I am undone without you.”<br /><br />I could write another page and a half about Harrow and Gideon and how much I love their dynamic and the theme of trust and how much this book was everything I wanted from a romantic side plot that wasn't even barely a romance but this review is long and it's late. <br /><br />Also really really cool magic and good fight scenes and a lot of mystery - in fact so much mystery and science-fantasy babble that I need to reread the book and understand some of the things a little better. <br /><br />Also an ending that I loved and hated and I can't wait to read the next one as fast as I can. <br /><br />Wait also the weird writing style and dialogue and the characters and how they - <br /><br />End of review before I list everything in this book. It was very good. Probably not for everyone, but it was for me. Very much so."

      "review": "Rating: 3.75/5<br /><br />Before I even begin this review, please do know that this review might come off as though I did not enjoy this book due to how critical I got during analyzing this book. However, I truly did enjoy this book a lot, it was such a fun book to read, and was such a joy to see the characters interact with one another, and learn bits and pieces of this complex world and magic system. When I do decide to review books, I tend to be very nitpicky about everything and I tend to break down the entire thing and highlight the flaws a lot, no matter how much I enjoyed a story. (trust me I can break down all of my favorite books into their biggest flaws but that doesn’t mean I love them any less!) This review will be split into showcasing, the plot, the world-building, characters, and writing. <br /><br /><b>\n  <i>ALSO BEWARE THAT THIS REVIEW IS KINDA A HOT MESS IDK WHAT HAPPENED BUT YEAH ENJOY</i>\n</b> <br /><br /> <b>Plot:</b> Gideon the Ninth follows Gideon Nav, at the beginning of the story, we see her getting ready and preparing on making her grand escape from the Ninth House planet, as she had lived there her entire life in isolation. However, after being caught she was then brought into a position of cavalier, which she had never trained for her entire life, in order to leave with Harrowhark Nonagesium, the heir to the Ninth House, who had been summoned by the empire to participate in trials in order to rise to the power of Lyctor. However, after arriving at the First House, where the trials are being held, other heirs and cavaliers are found dead, opening up to the mystery and seriousness of the situation that they now are in. Going into this story, I truly had no idea of what I was getting myself into, I did not know that this story was going to end up being a murder mystery at the end, which is completely fine with me since during the time I was searching for some fantasy murder mystery to read and somehow one just miraculously ended up in my hands without having to search for it too hard! This story was fun to follow and having Gideon as the main character to figure out this mystery added even more to it, however, due to the writing <i>which I will go more into later in the writing section cause woo, I have lots to say about that,</i> it had made the entire plot pacing feel so strange. In the story's first act everything felt like it was moving so fast that I truly had no idea what was going on, especially in this new and complex world. Then, we got into the second act all the way halfway to the fourth act I would say, everything began to slow down. I feel like a huge contribution to this problem was the fact that during the start of the second act, Harrow disappears off to do her own thing, forcing Gideon to navigate on her own due to orders that her necromancer had given her. As well since the writing style was definitely a struggle to work through, just caused the middle section of the book to feel so slow and felt like it was being dragged on despite the amount of high tension and suspense this part of the book provided. Then there was the ending. I won't go into too much detail about the ending to preventing on causing any spoilers, however, the ending, despite how heartbreaking it was for me and how much it steered away from the typical ending you would see in my eyes, I felt as though it didn't deliver the punch it was supposed to be. The main factor to this I believe is because the plot didn't provide the tension and the risk factor of the conflict as a whole. The conflict felt like it was just there, instead of showing how many problems this can cause, despite people dropping dead like flies. I feel like the ending could've been so much more impactful the way it is, if only the plot was much more structured and developed because at the end if we look at it as a whole, the plot did feel underdeveloped due to that pacing issue and the way everything was revealed, or better yet, not revealed and should've been. <br /><br /><b>Writing:</b> Oh boy, now when I went into this book, I have heard from many others that this book was confusing, but oh my god I was not expecting this. I understand how sci-fi can be difficult to understand genre due to how complex the worlds that this genre can contain, however this book I feel like taking it to a whole new level of confusion. The writing style was something that I never really got the hang of at the end of the book. There were lots of long paragraphs where at the end you don't really know what in the world you had just read. I feel like there's really no way for me to explain how confused I felt the entire time reading this book due to the writing style and the world-building. I've heard from others that this writing style was meant to be one that made you feel homesick, however, not once I had ever gotten that feeling while reading this book. It was truly just an utterly confusing style that never really did come around at the end sadly. <br /><br /><b>World:</b> Now lets talk about the world. I really do wish that the author had just gone down the route of info dumping because I feel like this is the biggest reason why it hindered my reading experience. This world is taken place in a universe where there are different planets, which are called Houses. There are nine total houses. I personally feel like I learned absolutely nothing about this universe except for the history of the Ninth House when Harrow went and confessed to Gideon about something towards the end of the book, that chapter was my favorite for multiple different reasons, one for how tender and vulnerable it was, and also I got more of a sense of how the world of the Ninth House worked at least. However, if you were to ask me to explain the world of this book I wouldn't really be able to give you a clear answer sadly. From the power structure, to why there are multiple different planets, I have no idea. This honestly sucks a lot of cause, this world is so complex, from the world itself to the magic system, which we know there are necromancers, however, we don't learn a lot about their magic as a whole solid foundation. I wished that we were able to dive deep into the history and the magic system of this world, cause even now I'm still so intrigued with the little snack-size information that we were given. <br /><br /><b>Characters:</b> My favorite part, going in deep about the characters. This book has an extremely wide and huge cast of characters from all different Houses/planets. However, with so many characters and not really understanding the housing system, it was quite difficult for me to keep up with who is who if they weren't Gideon of Harrow. However, in the end, I remember a few more characters, however, I still don't remember a huge chunk of the other half. I won't go in deep about Gideon and Harrow and their character arcs and I will be looking more at their relationship with each other instead. These two are not in a relationship and rather a partnership, I didn't really know whether or not these two were going to end up being a couple due to fandom art I've seen and the start of the book... however I can say that their friendship was one of a truly rocking one. They both grew up together, being the only ones of their generation in the Ninth House, and absolutely and utterly hated each other since the day they had met. Watching these two interact was a true joy, seeing Gideon being the sarcastic and joking person who is constantly poking at Harrow and Harrow being the serious, no-play person in response. <input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"spoiler__control\" aria-label=\"The following text has been marked spoiler. Toggle checkbox to reveal or hide.\" onchange=\"this.labels[0].setAttribute('aria-hidden', !this.checked);\" id=\"59602501-c052-405b-9884-7d7fa5fa2919\" /><label aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"spoiler\" for=\"59602501-c052-405b-9884-7d7fa5fa2919\">I feel like there was not enough time to properly develop the friendship that they could've had at the end. At the end of the book, you could see the two coming into a similar ground and beginning to appreciate each other and forgive one another and start to care about one another with seeing lots of vulnerable moments. I wished that this was more developed and had more time since I feel like this would've been the main and biggest factor in making the ending truly heartbreaking and showing how much of an impact it had made. </label><br /><br />However, despite me highlighting and airing out all of the flaws of Gideon the Ninth, don't think I hated this book because in the end I really enjoyed this book. It was a fun read and I felt like I didn't give this book the proper appreciation it needed and deserved, so I am definitely planning on rereading this in the future. Gideon and Harrow were a joy to read and I love the two so much, I’ll definitely be reading the sequel to this story soon. I would recommend this book to anyone who would like to read a complex science fiction murder mystery with complex world-building and absolutely sarcastic characters<br />"

      "review": "My experience reading this book, told in emojis: ❓❓❓❓😴😴😪😪❓❓❓😴😪😐🙃🙃🙃🤔🤔🤔😮🤔🤔🤔🤔😱😱🤔🤔🤔😮❓❓😱😱❓❓😱😱❓😱🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯<br /><br />Translation:<br />1st third: really confused and bored <br />2nd third: intrigued, creeped out, but still confused<br />Last third: mindblown, shocked, couldn’t put it down, devastated, still need a lot of questions answered thooooo…<br />((BUT I KEPT COMING BACK TO THAT FUCKING ENDING!!! WHAT. THE. FUCK.))<br /><br />This book is really all over the place so let me try to break it down:<br /><br /><b>Atmosphere</b>: Part comedy, part thriller, part horror, part mystery, part angsty romance. So much creepier than I thought it would be (for anime fans, I got heavy Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood vibes from this, especially re: the dog episode). So much less romance than I thought there would be. Yes Gideon is gay. Yes her feelings for other characters are hinted at. Does any romance actually happen or develop though? Questionable. <br /><br /><b>Worldbuilding</b>: TERRIBLE. I almost DNF’ed the book starting out because there were so many places, names, and terms, and none of it was described properly. Like, the synopsis to helped me visualize the setting than the actual book. Also the author tried to shroud a lot of the characters in mystery, but it came off less intriguing and more just poor writing and worldbuilding. Some of the mystery was never even revealed and the ones that were, were done so in a very info-dumpy format, which really killed the suspension and intrigue factor. There were also a lot conversations that involved complicated scientific theories, that I think the author included to try to make it seem all sci-fi and cool, but just served to make the story more confusing. <br /><br /><b>Pacing</b>: The book started off extremely slow, partly because you’re being introduced to so many new things at once. You’re forced to move at a slow pace in order to get properly acclimated to the world. There was so much going on that I wasn’t fully acclimated until2/3rds of the way through (I kept thinking that I got the hang of the book, but was proved sorely wrong multiple times lol). However, the last bit of the book was extremely action heavy, full of revealed mysteries and unexpected plot twists that made it both exciting and mind-reeling. Personally though, the plot twists weren’t as satisfying because I wasn’t able to make my own guesses about what was about to happen, since I spent so much brain space just trying to follow the story. <br /><br /><b>Characters</b>: Honestly the only reason I managed to finish the book. They weren’t the best written or most developed characters, but they were all interesting. Despite having basically 16 main characters, each of them had a distinct voice that differentiated them from the others. They also all had compelling hidden backstories (some that were revealed and some that weren’t) and it was fun to speculate exactly what each of the characters were hiding. However, it was still really difficult to keep them all straight in my head, especially when interpersonal conflict made their relationships complicated; I could never remember who were allies or enemies, or how each of the houses really felt about each other. <br /><br />As a side note, I could also sense a bunch of fascinating themes within the writing, but again, I spent so much brain power just following the basic plot that I had no space to really mull over them. I suspect I might have to reread the book to fully catch &amp; appreciate them all, but I’m not sure if I’m going to be doing that anytime soon lol… "

      "review": "Holy pizza with none beef. This was everything.<br /><br />I don’t want to say too much about this one, mainly because I wish to give zilch away- this book is so captivating but so much of that is the surprises, twists and turns leaving you unable to put it down (I seriously wondered if it was welded to my hand at one point folks.) <br /><br />This had me laughing so hard ‘I did offer him stupendous works of a titty nature…’ but the references throughout and humour that is just so enjoyably relatable was everything. <br /><br />This is one of my favourite sapphic books now , and I read a hell of a lot of WLW works. It’s just so perfect, so non focussed on questioning or judging sexuality that just is another trait. Just there without questioning. And I love this. Gideon is just queer as hell and it’s just a mundane fact about her and I love this. <br /><br />Also, necromancers in space? Hell yes. But this does have vague hunger games/ Harry Potter (the one with the triwizard cup) vibes, a dark and gritty side that I truly loved. There’s also some murder mystery thrown in as if it wasn’t fun enough already. <br /><br />Just go read this. Go read this perfectly queer, space opera that will keep my soul alive for the next year at least ✋🏻😂 Even if you don’t normally enjoy sci-fi, grab this. I would also recommend it to fantasy lovers as it’s strong on both fronts. "

      "review": "The quote on the cover of the novel is probably its best summary: \"Lesbian necromancers explore a haunted gothic palace in space!\" It's both what drew me to the book and what made me wary of reading it.<br /><br />In a way, it met my expectations. It was a pretty fun novel, but it also had the failings I expected. In short, I feel like this tries way too hard. To be clever, to be funny, to be new... Reading the summary and looking at the cover, I feared this would fall way hard into the \"t3h PeNgU1N oF d00m\" territory. And it does, but there's enough interesting stuff in there that the childish randomness doesn't become too overbearing.<br /><br />At heart, this is a haunted house story. A group of people all invited into an old house to discover its long-lost secret. The magic, the science-fiction, they're pretty much trappings on a well-worn central structure. All of the clichés and tropes are there, the professor, the priest, the jock, etc. It starts with the exploration of the old house, mysteries are revealed and the guests start disappearing one after the other. <br /><br />None of it was very surprising or original, but there's a reason why there're so many haunted house stories, they just work. There'll always be something gripping about a character exploring the unknown in the dark. Whodunnits are always interesting.<br /><br />I felt that the sapphic romance aspect (which was publicized quite a bit) was rather poor. The two main characters spend the majority of the novel hating and trying to kill each other and end up saying such terribly saccharine phrases like \"I can't imagine an universe without you in it!\" after, like, a single heart-to-heart. I know that hatred to love can be a fun concept to explore, but that's exactly it, it wasn't explored, it just happened. It felt infantile.<br /><br />The Fantasy/Sci-fi trappings were pretty original. I'm not sure I remember reading about a space-faring empire of necromancers. The lore behind the novel was pretty good, the nine houses, the Necrolord Prime, the dead star, etc. But I couldn't shake the feeling that the author herself couldn't take it seriously and only used those aspects to make her gothic haunted house/lesbian romance a bit different.<br /><br />After the elegance and the \"simplicity in complexity\" of Sanderson's magic systems, the necromancy here was just a mess, even after reading the explanation at the end. It's divided in weird categories and uses concepts which are ill-defined and hard to differentiate (thanergy, thalergy, thanenergy, thalenergy, etc.)<br /><br />Even though I'm quite harsh on this book, it was still entertaining. Kind of like a Marvel movie or a comic-book. I'll probably give the sequel, Harrow the Ninth, a quick look."

      "review": "Disappointing. The description and the great reviews built this up too much.<br /><br />Gideon Nav is a fairly standard fantasy hero. She is a young adult with mysteriously dead parents, paired with a mysterious past she herself isn't fully aware of. She's a great sword-fighter. She has overcome a nasty childhood in some sort of decaying charnel house of backstabbing royal necromancers. But, because it's so fashionable now, Gideon has all this crass, irreverent attitude! She swears casually and talks about her porn magazines sometimes.<br /><br />... Wow. Really groundbreaking stuff here.<br /><br />The actual storyline is kind've a snore. It's a competition vaguely reminiscent of a reality show. We are --barely-- introduced to a bunch of representatives from the nine \"houses.\" Most are forgettable. The nine houses are not, really, ever adequately explained to the reader. There are nine different cultures scattered across different --planets?-- or --space stations?-- in the far future, and they all have some degree of necromantic power in their blood. But not every person is a necromancer, and those who are, aren't even necessarily the same type of necromancer. We know that Gideon's partner is a specialist in bone magic. We don't actually know what the other specialties are, or even why \"bone magic\" counts as necromancy, and not just \"osteomancy.\" There doesn't appear to be any other kind of magic or psychic power in this universe aside from necromancy, in its many forms. But then again, how do I know that for sure? <br /><br />The representatives arrive on this --space station?-- in pairs, and they compete to acquire keys for the prize at the end. Oh yeah, and along the way lots of people die.<br /><br />It was a low-key lesbian Battle Royale crossed with Celebrity Big Brother.<br /><br />As a gay person, one of my biggest pet peeves is LGBT science-fiction that tries to act like homophobia doesn't exist. Sadly, that includes this novel. Whatever the Hell else it is. Because for all that Gideon is a lesbian (I think), and her surprising/unsurprising female love interest and she hate each other, no one in the entire novel expresses any surprise or consternation over any of the characters experiencing same-sex attraction. While I believe this is supposed to be set centuries in the future (although I do not know that for sure), and there's an argument to be made the author is saying she thinks our society will outgrow homophobia by then, I'm not sure I appreciate that. Because that isn't what my life is like now. As a gay person, I deal with homophobia, even if only in very small ways, all the time. And I'm not sure it really captures the LGBT experience to just fantasize about us no longer having to put up with that.<br /><br />Also, too many damn characters. Sometimes I lost track of who was who. Didn't help when a character revealed they were secretly somebody else, and suddenly I had a different name for that character to have to memorize.<br /><br />The world building is just bad. I was never clear whether we were talking about different planets or space stations, or why people have necromancy, or what the different fields of necromancy were, or why humans got divided into different \"houses\" in the first place. This story tried to effortlessly blend gothic aesthetics with futuristic space stations, and it just did not succeed. Hell, there wasn't even enough <i>imagery</i> in this book.<br /><br />Good effort. Not sure I appreciated the execution here. I won't be looking for the sequel."

      "review": "I’m kind of upset. I didn’t end up liking Gideon the Ninth as much as I wanted to or thought I would. <br /><br />The ending was unsatisfying for me personally. The world building was interesting but confusing at times with all the characters. The main thing that kept me interested was that it was essentially more of a murder mystery/thriller. It was giving Murder On the Orient Express. <br /><br />Also, it’s marketed heavily as having queer/lesbian romance. There are queer characters but there was no romance at all, (which is fine because it’s a fantasy story so that’s what I’m here for, but it felt kind of misleading since no characters ended up together anyway?? Maybe there is actually some romance in the second book, idk if I’ll be reading to find out) An excerpt at the end of the book specified that necromancer-cavalier relationships aren’t romantic. (I think… I’m pretty sure that’s what I read) <br /><br />Honestly I felt like Gideon and Harrowhark’s relationship or friendship didn’t have a natural flow and was almost hard to believe. There was the pool scene and then suddenly years of hating each other were washed away. If there had been more than just one intimate moment like that then maybe I could buy into it. Suddenly Gideon goes from trying 37 times to leave the Ninth house to join the Cohort to pledging her life to Harrow? Okay. I mean, good for her for playing hero at the end. Unfortunately Camilla was not recovered though, so kind of a flop.<br /><br />Can someone please explain to me why the Emperor can’t enter Canaan House? Either it wasn’t explained or I missed it. I need a background story on this dude.<br /><br />Gideon has the personality of a fourteen year old boy. A lot of her lines gave me the ick.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this book because the concept is so original. The suspense really did keep me hooked, but I don’t think I’m invested enough in the story as a whole to continue with the rest of the series. Somebody lmk if it’s worth continuing or not, thx."

      "review": "1/31/20: This book has killed me dead and I am too post-book incapacitated to elaborate. I will revisit once I've been resurrected.<br /><br />5/15/20: ok, four months later, I have come back to expound:<br /><br />First, to try and convince my friends to read this, I described the plot as: scions of the ruling families of necromancers of all different flavors in a post-technological-but-not-really society are called together to the ancient seat of power, and end up in a haunted house mystery where not everyone survives the highly entertaining and not-for-the-faint-of-heart mystery. I think that covers it pretty well. <br /><br />Note that I didn't add \"lesbian\" to qualify \"necromancers\", not because it isn't important IRL (it surely is because REPRESENTATION), but because it's not important to the plot. It is however also important to note that I personally have a crush on Gideon a mile wide and I'm not ashamed to admit it. She is *amazeballs* and made entirely of sarcasm, memes, upper arm strength, and badassery. And she's ginger. What else could I want in life?<br /><br />Heart-eyes for the protagonist aside, I loved this book. The blend of magic and technology is fabulously executed, the mystery is wonderful; my only complaint was that the characters were a little difficult to track once we get to the ancient site, since all the scions pretty much arrive at once. They're all very distinct characters though, so after a little bit where the character list is extremely useful, it becomes a nonissue.<br /><br />Also of note, Harrow is a fantastic character as well; wildly intelligent, talented, and ambitious, already used to running her own kingdom but reluctantly reliant on Gideon to be her sword hand. The grudging friendship between Gideon and Harrow though is *chefkiss* perfect. The frenemy-but-mostly-enemy to trusted ally dynamic is spot on, and their interactions are brilliant. oof. love. I can't say enough about it.<br /><br />Finally, speaking of memes: another author in a Tor interview observed that \"one of the best authors of our generation is a memelord\" and assured us that somehow the sequel, Harrow the Ninth, has a joke about left beef, and I'm already deceased. Coronavirus can't have me because it is imperative that I live to read the sequel."

      "review": "On paper, looking at the elements of the book, I think I would find this really annoying. Nothing is explained for a long time, and even then there are large parts of the book that you really just have to pick up from context. Gideon has this weird use of memes and modern humor that is completely incongruous to the setting and the other characters, to the point that it takes me out of the story sometimes. It's also really light on the lesbian aspect of the \"lesbian necromancers\" selling point of the book. But man, the characters in this book are so fucking great that it makes up for all of it. The moment we get to the 1st planet and start interacting with the larger cast the novel instantly becomes better for it.<br /><br />At this point rather than a traditional review, I'm just going to gush about what I love about some of the characters.<br /><br />Gideon - Gideon is like the female equivalent of a himbo (bimbo? herbo?). She's a dumb hunk with a heart of gold. It's so funny to me that so many of the characters are trying to figure out complex puzzles or are considerate and aware of the complicated political situation involving the empire and the houses, and Gideon doesn't care and just fucks around all day. You could literally see the lack of plot details in the story as reflecting Gideon not giving a shit about anything going on. I also really love how despite her vow of silence she's still extremely likeable and charismatic with most of the other characters. I love her, and it's so great that other characters instinctively love her too.<br /><br />Palamedes - He's introduced like he's supposed to be the nerd character but is instead the pragmatic version of the moral core of the story. He's just an incredible sweetheart, and I loved him from pretty much the first time he spoke to Gideon.<br /><br />Coronabeth - I don't personally love Corona, but I do love what she represents in the story. She looks and acts like a popular girl, but not one of those mean ones you see in films sometimes, someone that would actually be popular in most settings. She's attractive of course, but it's more that she's incredibly gregarious to anyone with seemingly no ulterior motives. She's the type of person you could see having no compunctions about inviting a bunch of introverts out with her group of extroverts because she doesn't see the difference, and then the introverts would go because it's for her.<br /><br />Camilla - Camilla is just a sassy badass and is my representation of the B99 meme where if anything happened to her I would kill everyone and then myself. She doesn't get enough scenes.<br /><br />The Fourth Teens - God, they're just so adorable. I love the use of smaller font text for the teens talking to each other, and I love how they immediately glom onto Gideon as someone they like and want to befriend. <br /><br />Dulcimea - Dulcimea is one the most fascinating characters in this for me. I was talking about this book with a friend and Dulcimea is so obviously manipulative with Gideon in a way that the reader will never not notice, but my friend is straight and just found her icky, whereas I'm a lesbian and I found her incredibly hot. I think it was interesting how we responded to her differently. I am 100% aware of what Dulcimea is doing with Gideon, but I can't help see that and think, \"yeah, that's really hot, I kinda might enjoy being fucked with like that too if the person doing it was as good as Dulcimea\". And I think she is really impressive as a character. A lot of fiction tends to use Corona-type characters for their manipulative ones, but Dulcimea's actions feel much more real to me, like how she has Gideon do small little favors for her as a way to get closer. There's a certain focus she has when interacting with people that you can't help find attractive. You want that attention on you.<br /><br />Harrowhark - Last, but definitely not least, Harrow herself. She's a type A, overachieving, arrogant, paranoid princess, and I love her. She fits some tsundere vibes in the way she can't help show her affection for Gideon despite all the animosity between them, and I loved every second of it. She's brilliant and she knows it, and it's really satisfying having someone chastise Gideon for being the stupid, sexy idiot that she is. Harrow is annoyingly right about most things, and I like that the book makes no excuses for her. She isn't even in the same category of charisma as Gideon, but it's also easy to see how some people can look past her front and see the gooey core underneath. <br /><br />This isn't the full cast, but these are the ones I really enjoyed. Some of the rest are fascinating in the way they interact with these characters, and all of the cast is interesting from that perspective, but they're not necessarily characters I would want to spend a ton of time with on their own. They're all brilliantly written though. It's a huge credit to the author that they were able to write such distinctive characters, and that their interactions always felt interesting to me."

      "review": "Please note there are SPOILERS in this review. Read at your own risk.<br />*<br />*<br />*<br />*<br />I’m not going to bother with a synopsis as there are plenty of reviews that have already covered that ground at length. Instead, here’s a list of what I liked and what I didn’t:<br /><br />What I liked:<br /><br />1. Though the universe is based on well-established concepts like space travel, necromancy and magic, it feels very unique. It takes the best elements from each and incorporates them, while also introducing new ideas which slot in seamlessly with the world at large. This made it fun to learn about the different schools of necromancy, how they functioned, and added to the overall originality of the story.<br /><br />2. Gideon Nav is the buff, butch, snarky sword lesbian of my dreams. Relatable, funny, unabashedly gay and often very stupid, I fell in love with her from the start. Her sarcasm and sense of humor were what kept me going in the beginning (because the first quarter of this book is a bit of a mess) and she’s the reason I laughed out loud many times. <br /><br />3. Once the actual plot kicked in, I really enjoyed the whodunit. It kept me engaged and guessing at every turn. The facility was also intriguing, and I found the mystery surrounding it and the First House a fun web to try and mentally unweave.<br /><br />4. Many of the supporting characters were enjoyable. I loved Magnus, Dulcinea and Palamedes. The dynamic between Coronabeth, Ianthe and Babs was fascinating. Teacher was infuriatingly vague, but still interesting, as it was obvious he knew more than he was letting on. <br /><br />What I didn’t like:<br /><br />1. Several of the descriptions are overworked and overwrought, making the book an unnecessarily confusing read. Word choice was a big factor here, as it often felt as if the author spent too much time digging through a thesaurus for words like ‘prolix’ when ‘overly verbose’ would have sufficed. The writing style worked very well when it came to characters and characterization, but fell on its face the minute any kind of architectural or world-building elements were the focus.<br /><br />2. Harrowhark. Am I supposed to like her? Understand her? Have empathy for her? Because she came across as a bossy, manipulative, cranky know-it-all who put Gideon on her shitlist just for having the sheer audacity to be alive. At the end, I didn’t care about her any more than I did at the beginning, mostly because I wasn’t allowed to get to know her. She’s just plain missing through several parts of the book, and other than her few moments of chastising everyone in her ‘sepulchral tones’ she’s bland and humorless. Yes, I’m aware the next book is titled ‘Harrow the Ninth’. I won’t be reading it, which brings me to my last point.<br /><br />3. I’m a lesbian, and I am really, really, REALLY fucking tired of dead lesbians. How I wish the author had picked another trope, because this one always leaves me with such a nasty taste in my mouth that it inevitably sours the whole thing. There are plenty of reviewers out there saying they’re heartbroken RE: the ending. I’m not heartbroken; I’m furious. Gideon was a treasure, a rare gem among characters, and now she’s gone. And all I’m left with is another quirky coming of age story built on the bones of another dead lesbian."

      "review": "-The aesthetic of Smeerensburg in the beginning of the movie Klaus, or perhaps Corpse Bride. The mystery of an Agatha Christie locked-door murder. The tension of (intense) enemies to (mild) lovers. And the pervading feeling of the game Amnesia, what with the laboratories in a decrepit castle, unholy experiments, finding keys to unravel a mystery that you were plopped in the middle of, and being stalked my a nameless horror. All through the aviator-glasses-covered eyes of an irreverent queer tank.<br /><br />-You have to be open to not knowing what the hell is going on in this world for a super long time. Longer than your average fantasy or sci-fi novel I would say. This is compounded by the fact that it’s a large cast of characters and everyone is called at least 3 different names it seems; first, last, title, actual nickname, Gideon’s irreverent nickname for them, etc.<br /><br />-Twist! Twist! Twist! Twist! So many twists. But they fell into place, so it totally worked. <br /><br />-The only reason it doesn’t get 5 ⭐️ is because it took a long while to get going and it isn’t exactly a quick read. I had no idea what direction we were supposed to be going in until maybe 50%? <br /><br />-The tagline of Lesbian Necromancers in Space is slightly misleading because they were only in space for a minute. Necromancers actually hate space because there is nothing out there for them to work with. Makes sense.<br /><br />-I will never again think of all the rippling muscles in romance novels in the same way. “The man who’d put the sword to her neck was uncomfortably buff. He had upsetting biceps. He didn’t look healthy; he looked like a collection of lemons in a sack.” <br /><br />Other notable quotes I loved:<br /><br />-“In Gideon’s mind she looked like an evil stick.” <br /><br />-“‘Ha-ha,’ said Gideon, ‘first time you didn’t call me Griddle,’ and died.” <br /><br />-“‘Strike me down. You’ve won. I’ve lived my whole wretched life at your mercy, yours alone, and God knows I deserve to die at your hand. You are my only friend. I am undone without you.’”<br /><br />"

      "review": "This book is WEIRD. In a good way. But just be prepared. <br /><br />To be honest the beginning was too slow for me and I almost DNF'd it. I'm so glad I finished it though, the book gets really good about one third of the way in. At first, I didn't feel that the author did a good job of world building and making the world seem cohesive. I kept reading a sentence and being like wait what? It was very confusing at first. I also had trouble understanding the relationship between the main character and Harrow, based on the way they speak to each other.<br /><br />Overall this story is fantasy (there's necromancers) in space! It slightly reminded me of Dune, but if Dune didn't take itself seriously at all and was kind of silly and just very entertaining. The writing style is totally different from Dune though. The premise is that there's different dynasties controlling different planets (nine houses). And some of them have secrets. The emperor basically calls the royals from these families to compete for a prize...and then halfway through the book it turns into a who-dunnit when there's a murder. At that point, the book got REALLY interesting and I started to love it.<br /><br />The ending is pretty weird but it made me want to read the second book, so there's that. <br /><br />TLDR: Lesbian necromancers in space, with a murder mystery. <br /><br />Also, just be aware that this is not a spicy book. Just in case you're looking for that. Or not looking for that. I actually loved that there's LGBT representation throughout, but there isn't actual sex happening in the book. It's a story about a person who happens to be a lesbian, but the story is definitely not about that. And that representation was great. "

      "review": "WOW!!<br /><br />I wasn't really sure what this book was about before I started reading it - to be honest, I thought Nona the Ninth was the lesbian book, and that Gideon was a man. I'm not much for death and decay, but I devoured this book and am incredibly thankful my library hold has come in for the second already!<br /><br />The \"queer necromancers in space\" tagline for this book is definitely accurate, but I would not classify this as a romance-centric novel at all. It begins as Gideon's story, with witty remarks in parentheses and references to illicit magazines, and evolves into an epic of planetary, and eventually universal, proportions. <br /><br />As much as the narrative takes its sweet time opening up, I think it's without a doubt worth the wait. Gideon is a fairly typical YA protagonist, obsessed with rebellion and acting for her own audience. I can see where she might rub some people the wrong way, but I have a soft spot for characters like that and I think that's why I enjoyed the first section of the book. The real highlight is the ending section, Act 5.<br /><br />If you're looking for a YA fantasy with a unique twist, definitely give Gideon the Ninth a try! "

Being queer myself, I liked the representation, but I have qualms with a man writing a lesbian romance. I tried to see if the author was a part of the queer community, but I couldn't locate anything on his social media. Qualms aside, the slow-burn romance was done tastefully, but it definitely felt rushed at the end, almost like the slow-burn was a tad too slow.<br /><br />As for the overall plot, I adored it for the same reasons I love games like Animal Crossing; it was cozy and low-stakes (the author's words). It was a nice change of pace from the battle-filled fantasy books I normally read."

      "review": "This will probably be my longest review yet, but “Legends &amp; Lattes” gave me a lot to think about when it comes to rating a book, and I need to talk about that and get things off my chest first.<br /><br />There are several ways of critiquing the quality of art in general, but a lot of clever people have talked about that before. People who know a lot more about that subject than I do have created theories and said many great things about for instance originality, creativity, composition, meaning, clarity, technique, editing, resemblance etc. in terms of theme or design and so on, but relevant to my review here are some of my own personal thoughts - not on how to properly judge the quality of art, but on what is a fair personal judgement.<br /><br />On the one hand, I enjoyed “Legends &amp; Lattes”, but on the other, and overall, I simply didn’t like it.<br /> <br />One of the things I’ve realized is that there’s always something I can learn from experiences that I feel or think are, at first, bad or negative in some way. This is especially true for art, because those experiences can give me a deeper understanding and appreciation for what I do find enjoyable, if I take some time to reflect on that experience. Much like what I do for myself with this review.<br /><br />I did become aware of how much my level of enjoyment here was predicated on these three things:<br /> <br />1. What I hoped the book would be.<br />2. What I expected it to be.<br />3. My previous experiences with comparable stories. <br /><br />I do make a conscious effort to judge a book - without disregarding my personal preferences completely - on its own merit. To me, that means ascertaining genre as a way of grounding me in a fixed and intelligible perspective of the story I’m about to read, and what is expected of me as a reader. I need some frame of reference to both understand and enjoy it. I also do try my best to consider the intent of the author (whether they have a message, what kind of mood they were trying to evoke, or feelings they were trying to convey, themes and issues they discuss etc.). I would then judge the book based on these premises and how well the story essentially lived up to those perceived intentions and expectations. I should of course be ready to give authors the benefit of any doubts I may have and be open to the idea that I’ve come across something that can’t be readily defined and ultimately understood or enjoyed in a completely different way than I’m used to.<br /><br />For obvious reasons, I started reading this book with my mind and heart set on a queer fantasy romance story. <br /><br />Which, in my opinion, had a poorly realized fantasy setting. There were very little in terms of descriptions of otherworldly places (like cities and landscapes), use of magical elements (spells or items) or even non-human cultures or ways of life that differed from our own, and the very premise of the story is as earthly and unimaginative as can be (opening a coffee shop).<br /><br />The book also showcased a very unexciting fantasy story, in which I desire something adventurous, something heroic, something powerful and inherently magical. Most of the story here takes place inside said coffee shop, so the narrative became fairly mundane as well (they renovate and open a coffee shop, staff is hired, stuff is ordered. Then they go about selling coffee and baked goods to customers, and then they do it all over again). They didn't sell anything magical either, nor did they make anything in a magical or mysterious manner. Anything that actually was magical, consequently felt out of place.<br /><br />And while I appreciated the various characters - who were impressively distinct and had great personalities – they just did not appear non-human in most ways, even if they were described as such. Most of them were indistinguishable from humans most of the time, and I simply forgot that they weren't humans after a little while. It's not enough to just say that this is a fantasy world and that there are different kinds of non-human creatures there, I need the setting to be richer, and the characters to fully embody their differences and non-human qualities in a broader, more elaborate way. <br /><br />The queer and romantic aspect felt lukewarm at best to me as well. The characters that do engage romantically have very little romantic interaction throughout the story. <input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"spoiler__control\" aria-label=\"The following text has been marked spoiler. Toggle checkbox to reveal or hide.\" onchange=\"this.labels[0].setAttribute('aria-hidden', !this.checked);\" id=\"16d27b2c-d532-4b01-aad2-5959470af5be\" /><label aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"spoiler\" for=\"16d27b2c-d532-4b01-aad2-5959470af5be\"> The relationship between Viv and Tandri was platonic at first. They were colleagues. Then they became friends. And then very good friends. It was a lovely little wonder to behold, but they never seemed very romantically interested in each other for most of the story, and not very interested in romance in general. They just felt relatively unromantic together, and it all felt a bit forced towards the end. </label><br /><br />I think it was well written, to be fair, and had the perfect balance between dialogue, action, description, metaphors and ruminations.<br /> <br />Sure, it was a lovely, wholesome, optimistic, cozy story about living peacefully, chasing your dream and working hard for it. I just needed more. More food for thought, more action, more depth, more exploration of themes. Even more character development, and certainly more magic.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there are limitations and pitfalls of genre labeling, which were a detriment to this book and somewhat of a disservice to the author. Based on my way of reading a book, it just left me wanting for so much more on all aspects. You could argue that genre expectations, perceived or expressed intentions from the author or your hopes and previous experiences are either unfair or unreliable ways to consider a story’s own merit and quality. I generally don’t.<br /><br />As I near the end of my review, if you’re still reading, let me ask you this:<br /><br />Can you judge a comedy based on how poorly it scared you? A horror story based on the lack of romance? Or, you know, a children’s story based on the absence of philosophical debates about depravity and torture, or heck, even a nonfiction book about magpies based on its inability to sufficiently discuss significant aspects of aesthetic hedonism in French literature in the 19th-century? I don’t think so. It just doesn’t make sense to me. <br /><br />Let me put it differently: What if an author wanted to make you laugh, and you were horrified instead? What if an author wanted to create suspense, and you thought it was predictable and boring? What if they, like here, tried to make a romantic story, and you didn’t feel or even realize any of the characters were attracted to anyone? Is it fair to say that that they failed for you? Is it fair to give a lower rating based on that? I would say it’s fair enough.<br /><br />Finally, how do we consider a story’s own merit without a personal or basic literary frame of reference? I mean, you could just ignore genre labels or any intentions completely and ask yourself whether the book gave you what you wanted or something you needed. Or if it gave you anything else that you thought was worthwhile after the fact. Or whether it didn’t, of course. Some would call it unfair to rate a book based on that, some would not. I know what I want and I know what I need from a book, and I appreciate any positive outcome, but when it comes to my final judgement and rating, I try to consider all these things combined. I do feel like I have tried to do just that to the best of my abilities here.<br />"

      "review": "I will be honest, I read this book because it was nominated for a Hugo award and I have a mildly masochistic personal commitment to read every nominee I can and remain culturally literate in the genre at large. Otherwise, I’m quite certain I never would have touched it – everything about the pitch and marketing made it seem like something I would hate. I’ll try to be fair and approach the book on its own terms but, well it wasn’t exactly painful I wouldn’t say my initial impression was exactly wrong either. <br /><br />The book follows Viv, an orcish adventurer in a generic D&amp;D fantasy sort of world, as she decides to retire from the dungeon-delving/monster-slaying game with her last big score – a magical stone that, when buried, is supposed to bring ‘the ring of fortune’ to whatever you do above it. She opens the city’s first and only coffee shop. The book follows her collecting a cast of lovable misfit friends/employees (Calamity the hobgoblin carpenter, Tandri the succubus barista/eventual love interest, Thimble the ratfolk baking savant, a bard whose name I’m blanking on, etc) as they run the business and develop it into what by complete coincidence will end up looking very familiar to the reader’s own experiences with coffeeshops. There is theoretically some conflict happening, first with the local mob boss and then with one of Viv’s old adventuring companions, but they both feel pretty perfunctory and like they’re only there out of a sense of obligation.<br /><br />The actual meat of the book is basically focused on Viv instantly becoming fast friends with all her employees/coworkers and how endearing they are, and also the step-by-step of the coffee shops transformation. First in renovating the property into her vision, then in the branding and marketing, and then the gradual addition of menu items and live music. Through it all Viv and Tandri have a developing romance that (rather appropriately) feels like a coffeeshop AU fanfic where the author decided the slowburn tag meant ‘every other character will just act like they’re already dating by the halfway point but they’ll act like flustered teenagers and refuse to actually discuss their feelings until they kiss on the literal last page’. <br /><br />So, the book is ‘cozy fantasy’ which as far as I’m aware does actually just mean ‘no tension slice of life fanfic but with original characters’ (alternatively, ‘2000s ‘cute girls doing cute things’ anime but with a moderately more varied cast and in sf/f book form’). The only other books in the genre I’ve read are Becky Chambers’ stuff which, while I didn’t particularly love them, I know feel I was being far too harsh on. Those have legitimately impressive worldbuilding and coherent themes and at least gestures at real compelling character arcs and dilemmas. This, well, what you see is what you get? Like, there’s zero false marketing, but the entire book is just hitting the exact broad emotional beats you would expect it to. There’s not really any interest in the world beyond the cafe, it is in fact a plot point that Viv attracts a found family she clicks perfectly with and their relationships are all uniformly positive, and there is exactly one point where she suffers any sort of real reversal – which lasts for about five pages before everyone comes together and rebuilds things even better than ever. There is a wizened gnome whose clearly living time backwards who takes the time to pat Viv on the should and reassure her that everything turns out alright, in about as many words. <br /><br />Morality in the book is basically synonymous with niceness. If someone is friendly or at least polite to Viv then even if they seem like an obvious problem in the end they’ll turn out to have their heart in the right place and only want the best – as, for example, the local crime boss proves to be a nice old lady who accepts an order of cinnamon buns every week as ‘protection money’ and donates several shipments of materials to rebuilding the place without any expectation of payment or stake in return. The only two characters in the book who are rude assholes to someone in the cafe are also coincidentally the only real villains there are. <br /><br />All of this is stuff that on some level I more or less expected opening into the book. The thing that actually disappointed me is that this fluffy book about opening a coffee shop doesn’t actually care about coffee at all. If you’re going to make it the centrepiece of your whole book, I expect some exultation and appreciation of the stuff, self-indulgent passages going into detail about the smell and taste and smell and experience of it. But the book’s mostly interested in the, like, trappings and signifiers associated with a cafe, not (despite Viv’s theoretical obsession with it) the actual coffee. This feels like a significant point. (There actually is a decent amount of detail spent on the baked goods their genius baker invents, which just makes the lack feel stranger.)<br /><br />As an aside, and I know this is very clearly not a book that expects you to care about the worldbuilding, but it’s kind of strange that coffee is presented as this new exotic novelty to a vaguely European fantasy metropolis that is explicitly already familiar and comfortable with tea? Like obviously the historical analogues aren’t worth getting into – Viv is creating a cute neighberhood coffeehouse by a college campus, no a 17th century Venetian cafe – but it’s not the first place I’ve seen the same portrayal of the two drinks and it’s, odd? Like it’s not like tea is any less foreign to Europe, or arrived particularly earlier. <br /><br />But anyway, yeah, didn’t enjoy this but can’t say I was misled. It is in fact a book that you can entirely judge by its cover and not be surprised one bit. "

      "review": "➥ 2 Stars *:･ﾟ✧<br /><br /><blockquote><b>What flames could not consume, never shall be extinguished.</b><br /><br />━━━━━━━━━━━ ♡ ━━━━━━━━━━━</blockquote><br /><br />Sadly, this was underwhelming at best for me. Though this had decent writing and an endearing premise, it fell flat for me in so many ways.<br /><br />I would like to say, though, that I've come across a couple of people refusing to read this book because there is a sapphic romantic subplot and, yes, this book is written by a man. But really, there was nothing harmful about the portrayal at all. And, considering how many women write both good and bad achillean books, I'm not at all mad about a man respectfully writing a genuine sapphic couple.<br /><br />Now, this book felt like a drag through the mud, but mud that had 20 of the same speed pumps. It just felt quite repetitive. Open the coffee shop. Buy a coffee machine. Buy coffee beans. Hire employee. Hire musician. Buy a stove. Hire a pastry chef. Add things to the menu. And that just went on and on and on.<br /><br />If this had been done alongside a strong development of characters and relationships between characters, I probably wouldn't have minded it as much, but I found those areas were sorely lacking too. I'm aware the sapphic romance is very much a subplot, but there was a total of 3 moments where there was a hint at romantic feelings between the characters and that's it. I didn't feel any intensity or any strong love or attachment at all. The characters themselves were okay. I liked Tandri at the beginning: she was quippy and smart. But somehow, she lost this fun personality as the book progressed. Not to mention the sheer number of characters. I managed to keep track of them, but only barely. The author just kept adding more and more: if it wasn't the new employee that was hired in every chapter, the author started to place spotlights on the customers too. Overall, very tedious.<br /><br />At the beginning of the novel, I'd held out hope that things would eventually speed up and I'd get pulled in to the story and characters, but that never really happened. I understand that \"low-stakes cozy fantasy\" doesn't inherently mean \"no stakes\" but there was a twist (if I can call it that) that just felt very out of place, random, and useless. It wasn't entertaining, it didn't further the characters' development, and it wasn't a segue into something more interesting.<br /><br />Like others have noted, the fantasy world-building is extremely lightly done. At first, I didn't have a problem with it, because 1: the cover is absolutely beautiful and perfectly encapsulates how I imagined the coffee shop, and 2: because I just assumed that it was a kind of medieval town. But then, the author started to haphazardly throw in other magical elements and conflicts that just didn't work, if I'm being frank. I didn't care about the rock, I didn't care about the Madrigal, and for fucks sake, why was there a character named Gallina?? <br /><br />If that doesn't sound too bad for you, and you really wouldn't mind following a repetitive, incoherent storyline about characters doing mundane things (repeatedly), then don't let me stop you. The writing was pleasant and it did have a \"cozy\" feel to it. Sadly, though, it definitely didn't work for me, and I do regret dropping $21 for it.<br /><br /><blockquote>━━━━━━━━━━━ ♡ ━━━━━━━━━━━</blockquote>"

      "review": "I knew this would be slow, as it is a cozy fantasy, however I thought it was a little too slow for my liking at the beginning. And even though I have a lot of respect for that, because it's not a type of fantasy that is delved into very often, I assumed this book wouldn't be for me. Boy, was I wrong. After a certain amount of pages I really started warming up to the characters, and by the end, I was very much attached to them. I even teared up a bit, from the warmness and happiness it made me feel. Any book can make you emotional with sadness, but I find that it is much rarer and harder to accomplish to do so with happiness. And the wlw representation, while not at the forefront of the story was much appreciated. I love that we've been having a surge of queer books, and I would love to see more that don't necessarily center the romance like this one.<br /><br />This was a quick and refreshing read and I would highly recommend, however I don't think it is for everyone. I feel a lot of people would get bored of this easily, but if it has peeked your interest definitely pick it up.<br /><br />PS: While absolutely not necessary, I think having experience with dnd would make this a tad bit more enjoyable to read, and perhaps easier to digest. Personally I appreciated a lot of details that I wouldn't have otherwise, I feel."

Would've enjoyed this more as a graphic novel. @the author, it is not your fault that your book is being touted as the premier cozy fantasy book to read, which colors this review heavily because as I read it, I was perplexed and upset by how many reviewers and influencers gushed over it. This book was clearly a passion project and is filled with love for the characters (was this, perhaps, the author's DnD character for a year-long campaign? I would not be surprised). Yet, it is so derivative and uninspired that it became its own enemy and is in the end just an average coffee shop romance with fantasy flavors. Except it's a fantasy coffee shop romance with 1) unoriginal fantasy elements 2) lackluster coffee shop/fixer upper elements and 3) a boring romance. What is left? Nothing but novelty. <br /><br />Reader, why read this when you could be reading other cozy books/fantasy of manners like Howl's Moving Castle, Dealing With Dragons, The Goblin Emperor, All Systems Red, A Natural History of Dragons, Tooth &amp; Claw, et cetera, et cetera? Or go read a coffee shop au of your favorite fantasy couple. I promise you it's better."

      "review": "liked this surprisingly more than i thought i would given my mileage with \"cozy\" stuff is incredibly low. i found this to be more authentic than a lot of the \"cozy\" derivative shit people on here and booktok normally push, likely due to it's self-published origin, but it mostly felt like i was reading post-campaign fanfic for someone's D&amp;D PC where i didn't know the characters or the campaign, so it was hard to care. although i did love tandri, and the little rat man who made the cinnamon rolls. that was nice. <br /><br />i'm kind of ontologically opposed to the concept of \"cozy\" stuff - because what even does that mean? anything can be cozy. i think it's no coincidence that cozy is becoming its own marketable genre when political neutrality is at an all time high - but this is maybe not the place for That Rant. just know i find cozy games and books to fit in the paradigm of \"The Worst Person You Know Loves Hello Kitty\". legends and lattes, at the very least, was pretty queer in its storyline. and i don't even mean that in terms of the romance (if you can call it that.... for one of this book's main selling tools, it sure did feel nonexistent) but rather the plot motivator. the urge to escape from the socioeconomic confines of what you were born as and make a new life for yourself, one where you feel safe and comfortable to enjoy softness combined with the concept of real, true community and viv being a union loving profit sharing icon was like ... okay queer leftism!! did not enjoy the neoliberal \"if ur mean back to the people who are literally threatening you and harming you ur just as bad as they are\" overtures though, but i've come to accept that this is impossible to avoid in modern fiction. <br /><br />anyway. this was cute. the audiobook was really good. it was nice to read on my couch with a big bag of cookie dough bits. i probably won't think of it again or pick this author up a second time, though.

As it states, this is a ‘high fantasy with low stakes’, and while that may not sound thrilling to typical fantasy readers, the writing made scenes like cleaning up a dilapidated old building into a comforting adventure. The author truly wrote a story that was absolutely perfect for their writing style. <br /><br />Viv is an adventurer who wants to retire and open Thune’s first coffee shop, a beverage no one in the region has even heard of. Viv doesn’t think she’s worth good things due to her past but continues to work towards her dream, and it’s beautiful to see a character overcome their past and create a new, simpler life. Each of the characters we meet has their own story and you gradually come to care for each of them, hoping that they’ll each reach the dream they are chasing. Viv and her new companions really do feel like your old friends by the end of the book. From quiet yet gifted Thimble, direct and caring Tandri to gruff Cal and his few words. You simply have to read this book for the pure joy of watching the little rat Thimble enjoy his lattes!<br /><br />The romance was soft and slow, allowing the main focus of the story to be on the coffee shop and Viv creating a new life. I appreciated how the author didn’t make the later section all about the romance. It was a lovely romance that was even sweeter after learning the backstories of both characters. As a queer woman I loved seeing a sapphic relationship represented so well.<br /><br />For a cosy fantasy, it had just enough suspense and a taste of action to make you really appreciate the cosy scenes. Plus, with Viv’s backstory and desire to be more than the brute she was, the action becomes something you don’t want since it would mean her going back to the way she was. It was a masterful technique. <br /><br />An absolute gem full of friendship and enjoyment of the simple things in life. This book will make you long for a trip to an atmospheric coffee with quirky patrons, and it made me wish so hard that I liked coffee! I give it 5/5 and is the best book I’ve read this year and I absolutely can’t wait for more cosy fantasy from this author!"

I'd say this is a really, really pleasant book, though not without a few flaws.<br /><br />I have to say that this book made me exceptionally hungry. I'm not sure how I managed to read the whole thing WITHOUT baking cinnamon rolls at any point. I was able to forgo coffee during my reading by pure willpower because I do most of my reading in the evenings, and I knew that if I had a mug of coffee I'd never get to sleep. <br /><br />In general, the plot for this book is....easy. This reminded me a LOT of cozy mysteries. Like, take the exact same story, subtract the light fantasy elements, add an off-screen murder...and you've got yourself a cozy mystery. You're here for the vibes, the characters, the setting, the coffee and noms; you're not here for the plot. The plot itself is...easy. There, I said it again. There was an attempt at conflict, but it was pretty mild and solved with cinnamon rolls (let's ignore for a minute that<input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"spoiler__control\" aria-label=\"The following text has been marked spoiler.

Everything kind of works out so neatly for the characters throughout the whole book, so the reader has no doubts that this tragedy would work out fine.<br /><br />There's also a whisp of a romantic subplot, which had both plus and minuses for me. On the minus side...I wish we could get a fun fantasy book WITHOUT a romance for once. Why can't they just be good platonic friends? Aren't those relationships just as valuable as a romantic one? On the plus side: the romance was very subdued, happened gradually, had queer representation, and wasn't at all the focus of the story. <br /><br />I mean....if you don't think about it too hard, this book is entirely warm and cozy and fun. Ignore the utilitarian writing, the questionable bribes, and the lack of genuine tension in the story. If you're here for a complex plot with high stakes, this ain't it. This is firmly grounded in the \"cozy fantasy\" genre, and shouldn't be taken too seriously."

      "review": "Source: Borrowed from the library (physical paperback)<br /><br />I was a little worried that my expectations would be too high, as this book was recommended all over the place in my groups. But I did enjoy this book as a cute and light story. I really enjoy female orcs, ever since playing World of Warcraft. Viv is a strong and tough fighter with a kind heart, which I love. I also like reading cozy mysteries and the \"non-mystery\" parts like the challenges of running their business. This is the first story of that type that I have read in a fantasy setting and it was a fun variation.<br /><br />There were a few things that bothered me because they felt a bit too shallow or hand-waved. The biggest one was Tandri's whole situation. I understand that she didn't want to be stereotyped based on her species. But my understanding is that usually, succubi are basically sex vampires, and they <i>need</i> that energy to live, it isn't just something they can walk away from. That concept appears to be present in this world as well, based on Tandri's initial job interview. I kept waiting for that to come up--presumably <i>that</i> why Tandri went to the university, to try to figure out some kind of alternative food source. Was she in any danger of losing control if she pursued a relationship with Viv? But it was never really explained except in the vaguest possible way, which left me feeling a little disappointed as it felt like the author hadn't figured it out either. There were some other things too, like <input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"spoiler__control\" aria-label=\"The following text has been marked spoiler.

If anything I would have preferred more of it as that plotline was so minor."

Sorry but as a queer person i don't know why the author decided to write non-men in a queer relationship when half the time viv read as??? a man. We get a weird short kiss about 250 pages in, they never talk about it until the last page when we get another short peck so advertising it as a cosy romance is absolutely false. <br /><br />The next point: the book included fantasy racism but seemingly accidentally paralleled real life racism and as such viv read as black, tandri as asian (over sexualized for just being herself), cal as jewish (as a hobgoblin that comes natural but ofc it had to be mentioned) etc but alas halfway through the book racism stopped existing bc business was booming and friendship or something. <br /><br />All conflicts were mid. The person set up to be the big bad just wanted some cinnamon roles, the surprise villain got (sorta) away with arsony and being poor is no issue when you have friends. <br /><br />Listen I love found family but the power of friendship does not solve every issue in the world. <br /><br />And yes it had 100 pages of building the shop, 100 enjoyable pages and then ended on building the shop again. AGAIN. So please, 3 stars would be generous bc no it did not have the cosiness i was expecting."

An orc’s life was strength and violence and a sudden, sharp end – but she’d be damned if she’d let hers finish that way.<br />It was time for something new.”</i><br /><br />And something new it is! I think the special thing about “Legends &amp; Lattes” is that the story starts exactly where other books usually end. The adventure is over, all the fights are won and Viv has the scars to prove it. She’s tired of her life as a soldier and after 22 years she craves some quiet and peace. A normal trade that will ensure she can enjoy a calm peaceful life, a place to call her own and lots of coffee to bring joy into the world. It’s a pretty humble plan but it’s definitely an honourable one. (One I fully support because reasons and mostly COFFEE! *lol*) So right after her last adventure Viv sets out to find the perfect place for her coffee shop and ends up in Thune. A little city whose residents have never even heard of coffee. A small obstacle Viv is sure she’ll be able to overcome once they taste her delicious drinks and goods. Well, and once her legendary Scalvert’s Stone starts to work its magic and provides her with some dire needed luck. ;-)<br /><br /><i>\"They called it a café. People just sat around drinking it from these little ceramic cups, and I had to try it, and ... it was like drinking the feeling of being peaceful. Being peaceful in your mind. Well, not if you have too much, then it's something else.\"</i><br /><br />I honestly loved this so much!!! I think I get the hype now, and why so many people loved “Legends &amp; Lattes”! This book is very different to other high fantasy stories and extremely slow paced but I think that’s exactly what makes it so charming. We follow Viv as she buys an old building, renovates it with the help of Cal, a hob who becomes one of her most trusted friends, and then starts her business by selling coffee and café latte. Sure, there doesn’t happen a lot, but it’s so nice to follow Viv as her long-cherished wish of being a coffee shop owner comes to fruition. It was a slow start, but boy, did I live for the way everything came together so nicely. I just loved the manner in which Viv went about setting up her business. She might have been a layperson but she trusted her gut instinct and made so many precious friends along the way. No matter if it was Tandri, the succubus she hired as a barista, or Thimble her rattkin baker, that created the most delicious pastries, Viv seemed to have a sixth sense for who to hire and to trust with her dream. It was so satisfying, wholesome and oddly soothing to read about every food that was added to the menu and boy, did this book make me hungry! Thimble sounded like a genius in the kitchen and I found myself wanting to taste his pastries. They sounded way too good! *lol*<br /><br /><i>\"Come on around here. I'll show you,\" said Viv. She was smiling, and for the first time, the building, the city, this place ... felt like hers. A place she'd still be tomorrow, the week after, next season, next year ...<br />Home.\"</i><br /><br />But not everything is perfect and there are clouds on the horizon. An old battlefield acquaintance is jealous of Viv’s success and a local gang has set their eyes on Viv’s shop and profit. Our quick-witted orc barbarian would never allow them to destroy what she built, though and with the help of her friends and a huge dire-cat named Amity she’s ready to defend what’s hers. I won’t go into more detail here because you’ve to experience this book yourself but I just wanted to say that I loved how so many of the shops customers became Viv’s closest friends. They all contributed something to make the place a safe haven and it was so beautiful to see how every single one of them fell in love with the idea of Viv’s shop. Also and this is so rare for a standalone novel, all the characters were unique and fleshed-out! No matter if it was Hemington, a standoffish student who made the wards for Viv’s shop, Pendry the shy musician, Durias the chess playing gnome or Laney, Viv’s old neighbour that couldn’t bake to safe her own life, they were all one-of-a-kind and gave so much warmth to the storyline. The kindness of the characters made my heart feel so full and I think that already says so much about this book. &lt;3<br /><br /><i>That’s not what I mean,” said Tandri, with surprising heat. “Sure, it might be fine this time, for this one thing … but once it’s an option, once she can pick that back up …” She pointed at the sword on the wall. “She loses what she won by building this place without it.”</i><br /><br />I can’t talk about the characters kindness without mentioning Tandri as well, because I loved her so much for being at Viv’s side from the beginning. They started out as strangers, then became friends and tentatively turned into more than that later on in the book. Such a satisfying slow burn romance that made me very happy for both of them. They both deserve happiness and a quiet peaceful life and the way they understood each other without saying anything was chef’s kiss. Give me more sweet and gentle romances like this one, please!!!<br /><br /><i>”You’d find few who know it, these days, but ‘the ring of fortune’ is an old sea-fey phrase. It means … a destined cadre, I suppose. Individuals brought together, like to like. Which can be fortunate, of course. Sometimes, nothing’s more fortunate than that!”</i><br /><br /><b>Conclusion:</b><br /><br />“Legends &amp; Lattes” is one of the most wholesome and tranquil books I’ve ever read. It floats by so steadily and it’s the perfect story it if you want to read something quiet, relaxing and rather uneventful. The found family trope in this book is perfection and the descriptions of Thimble’s delicious pastries made me hungry more than once. If you’re looking for something slow-paced and nice that will put a soft smile on your face: This is the book! <br /><br />___________________________________<br /><br />Short info: Yes, the hype around this book is real! &lt;3<br />This was so, so wholesome and sweet and the found family trope really gets a chance to shine in here! There doesn’t happen a lot, though and the book is very slow paced.<br />I guess it depends on your reading tastes, but for me this was perfect!<br /><br />Full RTC soon! I’ll write down a couple more thoughts because this was nice!! <br />____________________________________<br /><br />It’s time for a comfort read and every book reviewer, book blogger, bookstagrammer and BookTuber I know said that <b>“Legends &amp; Lattes”</b> is one of the best comfort books ever.<br />So here we are and since I’m in dire need of a comforting and wholesome story it seems like the right time to pick this up. =) Plus it’s queer too so this sounds perfect!<br /><br />Let’s find out if this is as amazing as everyone claims it to be. ;-)<br /><br />Find me on:<br /><a href=\"https://thesassylibraryfox.wordpress.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">My Blog</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/thesassylibraryfox3/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Instagram</a>"

      "review": "A cozy bit of a fantasy novel that was a decent read.<br /><br />I once played in a D&amp;d campaign where the DM had to beg me and another player to stop basically trying to play a tavern building sim within the campaign. This book scratches that ich. It's got simple characters who's relationships give the warm fuzziest, but maybe in a way that isn't completely earned in the writing. <br /><br />Some problematic parts: The author is an apparently straight man who is writing about a queer couple so we are probably fortunate that the romance plot is relatively under developed. In fact his main character was so relatively bland that her gender did not matter much at all and as a reader, beyond the fact that queer stories are selling well at the moment, I am not sure why the author chose to write a queer story. Maybe there is more background there, maybe there isn't. <br /><br />I also kept asking myself if I was comfortable with the basic premise. The main plot of the book skirts along a fine line of fantasy cultural appropriation. I don't think it quite gets there but it felt like the author wasn't aware of how close he got.<br /><br />While a decent read and an early/first? example of an interesting newish genre of slice of life fantasy, I hope we see more authentic writing from the author and more stories by the kind of people the genre seems to be about and marketed for in the future because I would like more of the genre as long as things don't get too Hallmark Channel.<br /><br />Criticism aside, if you are looking for something simple and cozy to read on a vacation or holiday, this isn't a bad balm to a chaotic world."

It took a few chapters but by a good 100 pages in I could feel myself falling in love with the story. It’s so light, breezy and cosy, it truly fits the definition of a comfort read and I can imagine it being a reread in the future. All the main characters were lovely but I had a weird soft spot for Thimble, he was adorable. I love the queer representation here, it’s not really established until the final act but sometimes it’s nice when it’s so organic and treated the same way as a heterosexual romance would. <br /><br />I will say I found the ending surprisingly abrupt, I thought there would be more of a final ‘conflict’ but that’s not to say I disliked the ending, I just think I MIGHT’VE preferred a slightly different and longer one. But it would be unfair of me to lower the rating for that considering the entire point behind this genre is it being relatively low stakes. I think, however, I would love to explore longer books of this style, because I really was sad to reach the end! A great little book that I would recommend to most people.<br />"

      "review": "Gosh darn it, this book is so cute! It's sweet, genuine, and optimistic, and I bet it would be just perfect for a day spent whiled away in a coffee shop. It's just...not much more than that. <br /><br />My favourite part of the book was about a third of the way through, where it has the feel of a workplace comedy. I was getting almost Michael Schur vibes at one point. There are some great comic beats where you're just waiting for the next coffee shop cliche to show up in fantasy guise, and the book almost never fails to deliver.<br /><br />Things faltered for me when the romance element snuck in--that's not the fault of the author, story, or characters, it's just not my preferred genre. I was relieved that the rom-com elements didn't become too overpowering, but I couldn't help but feel that the story lost something of the character of a fast-paced romp that I'd really been enjoying as the narrative spent more time on meaningful glances, fleeting touches, and other romantic standbys. Again, I realize this is just my personal preference, and I can definitely understand why a lot of people find the romance aspect very touching.<br /><br />In many ways, this reminded me of a Discworld story. That's a compliment: I LOVE Discworld. This is the sort of premise that would fit right in with the Industrial Revolution arc (somewhere around \"Going Postal,\" perhaps). I'm sure something much like this must have happened somewhere in Ankh-Morpork.<br /><br />And that's where the comparison brings me up short. Because the more I think about the Pratchettian resonances, the more I want to read Terry Pratchett's version of this story. Because \"Legends and Lattes\" has a great premise, but just skims the surface of it. The fantasy elements (e.g., different sentient species) are there, but don't do much beyond offer a bit of local colour. The parallels with the modern world are there, but they're taken for granted rather than examined or transformed. (It wouldn't take much work to revise this into a story about a cafe owner in the 2020s. Actually, I'd be shocked if more or less exactly that story doesn't exist already. It's probably a Hallmark movie.) There are gestures toward a larger world, but beyond a couple generic place names and references to \"old legends,\" there's little in the way of worldbuilding. On the one hand, it's not fair to compare one relatively short novel with a decades-long series, but I can think of single paragraphs in a Discworld book that convey more about its world than I got from this whole book.<br /><br />If it sounds like I'm blaming this book for not being a different book by a different author, I don't think that's what I'm doing. It's more that thinking of other books makes me realize what I miss in this one: a sense of immersion in a fictional world where what's happening matters. <br /><br />That brings me to the other thing that leaves me vaguely unsatisfied with this book: it doesn't really say much. I love light, funny escapism, but this feels just a shade too light and escapist. Everything's just a little too easy. This is partly explained by a fantasy MacGuffin, but even when it's not involved, even apparent disasters are quickly reduced to minor setbacks. This is a world where you can leave your past behind, and even when it catches up to you, you just need a bit of gumption to get it off your tail. It's a world where the power of love fixes problems quickly, cheaply, and neatly. I grinned and melted a bit at the happy ending, but after a few hours passed, I found myself thinking that it was a bit cheap, since it was achieved by basically giving the main character complete amnesty from the consequences of their actions. I could accept all that if the story seemed self-aware, but it didn't.<br /><br />Which brings me back to wanting the Terry Pratchett version of this book. It might have the same ending, but it would take longer to get there, and it would take a good hard look at where it was going the whole way. The characters' actions would matter, and they'd say something about both their world and ours. It would be like drinking a rich latte, whereas this book is more like an over-frothed cappuccino. It's sweet and pleasant, but ultimately too airy to really satisfy."

      "review": "Okay so this is one of the most successful fantasy books of the last couple of years and knows exactly what it's doing. Most of the problems I had with it are issues for me but will not at all bother someone who is actually into this kind of thing. <br /><br />The one exception is that I've seen this marketed a bunch of places as having a sapphic romance subplot and I'm sorry but it doesn't. Like there's some stuff there and they have plenty of platonic chemistry between our protagonist and her potential love interest but this did not work for me as a romance at all. There was basically no interest or tension until the last third of the book and even then I wasn't invested at all. I feel like it could have been added in another draft or two, but as is it reads like the author was like oh maybe I'll have something between her and the barista and just never got around to actually writing it. <br /><br />Other than that, all of the other problems I had with the book are just me not vibing with the genre. Like this is very much a standard D&amp;D world, which means that the world building is pretty messy and incohesive (I say this as someone with a great affection for D&amp;D). The economy doesn't make sense and neither does the introduction or development of any of the food. <br /><br />SciFi has a distinction btwn hard and soft that is basically about how sciencey the science is and I really wish we had that for fantasy. Generally in fantasy, hard and soft has to do with magic systems and how much we know about them, but I'd love it for politics and culture as well. And so in the same way that a book might be soft SF, this is soft fantasy. Like if you care about thinking through how new and unique foodstuffs are going to be introduced to a new culture or the kinds of oversight (or lack thereof) that a pseduomediavalist town would have over outsider mercenaries moving in and attempting to set up businesses, this book will give you none of that. But so long as you aren't the kind of person who spends time wondering where our protagonist sources her coffee beans from (or are capable of chilling the fuck out for any length of time), you'll have a good time. The world building doesn't make sense but the vibes are on point and given that this book is literally all vibes, that's fine. <br /><br /><input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"spoiler__control\" aria-label=\"The following text has been marked spoiler.

Like a warm cup of coffee (lol), a hallmark movie but better, and a cozy fire on a rainy day. <br /><br />This book is advertised as a sapphic fantasy romance, which it definitely is! But more so I think it's a queer story about found family. And god it was so so good. Read it!! Give yourself a little treat. You deserve it.<br /><br />Also I was a little wary of the audiobook bc it was read by the male author, but fear not - audio is wonderful. Found out afterward he's a professional narrator so!"

LEGENDS &amp; LATTES is a fantastic little novel about Viv, an orc who lays down her sword and her career as a fighter to pursue a quieter life running a coffee shop in the sleepy town of Thune. There’s a dash of conflict, a healthy dose of slow-burn sapphic romance, and an absolutely lovable cast of characters, including a giant protective cat. I can’t recommend this highly enough. Also, the audiobook is performed by the author, who just so happens to do that for a living, so you better believe it’s excellent.<br /><br />Content warnings: fire/arson, some sexual harassment"

      "review": "No hate to anyone who loved this book, but it was missing a lot of critical things that make even low stakes, cute and cozy books work for me. So consider yourself warned, I did not love this book. Maybe skip this review if you're not looking to hear criticisms. <br /><br />Viv was a sword wielding orc adventurer. She led the \"hulk smashing, beating up monsters, sleeping under the stars, never settling down in one place\" life...until her last job left her with the loot she had been looking for...a lucky rock. Yup. Park it on the right magical lay lines, and it will help you achieve your hearts desire. Or at least that's what some song lyrics and forgotten legends say. And what is Viv going to do with this lucky rock? Open a coffee shop, of course!<br /><br />Ok, the idea sounds super cute. And the cover really paints a picture. Lesbian coffee shop owners in a fantasy setting? Yes, I want it! So much potential. I had this book on my TBR shelf for the longest time, after a strong recommendation from a friend. Then a second friend raved about it, and I bit the bullet, spent a credit, and got the audiobook. The reviews seemed overwhelmingly positive, and I was excited to read it.<br /><br />In the opening scene of this book Viv gets her rock. She then finds the spot for her coffee shop, and then...the author spends 20% of the book making us watch Viv build the literal building. Find the spot. Buy the spot. Find the perfect builder...oh hey, the very first person is 100% perfect and can totally drop everything to build this coffee shop! And find all the supplies she needs with no problem! Also money is no issue, because Viv is rich after all that adventuring. She gets her coffee beans, works with tools, pulls out rotten beams, builds with lumber, wakes up each day, thinks about her magic rock, gets more supplies...just no. No thank you. 20% of the book does not need to be this. I don't need to know about the nails she needs to buy for her building. This is neither cute, nor cozy. It is dull. <br /><br />Now, what makes this even less tolerable is that we are following Viv, but don't really seem to be inside Viv's head, because we almost never hear her thinking...anything. Most of the book is just us watching her as she does things. And since she isn't doing much beyond building her shop, we're left with very little sense of this character. Sure, she's a big strong orc who loves coffee and wants to open coffee shop, but beyond that? She's pretty bland. We are watching Viv, but not often seeing the world through her eyes, and it makes her feel very flat and one dimensional.<br /><br />So finally, at the 25% mark, we meet the other character on the cover, Tandri, a succubus who just wants to be recognized for her competence and achievements rather than for being a succubus. It was at this scene that I finally looked up the author, who I knew nothing about. After Viv's stumbling, stuttering, bumbling interview with Tandri, I had a strong sense that this book was written by a man. I was not wrong. So much was lacking from these characters, and much of their simplistic naïveté and insecurities didn't make sense for who they supposedly were. Oh, and don't get too excited about Viv's...would we call it interest? in Tandri. Never will Viv have a thought about Tandri or display anything other than the friendly, platonic interest of a friend and co-worker until the very end of the book. Even when they go on a picnic, there is NO burn whatsoever. No looks, glances, thoughts, admirations, touches, or moments. They literally just go on a picnic, make polite chit chat, then go home. They almost never even have any conversations that aren't about the coffee shop and running the business. I was HIGHLY unsatisfied with the supposed \"romance\" between these two. <br /><br />For most of the rest of the book, things continue to just happen, with almost no challenge or obstacle. Low stakes indeed. The coffee machine arrives. It can be used right out of the box...doesn't need cleaning or assembly or oiling or anything. Just...add beans and water. They open the shop the very next day. Viv hasn't even made a menu or planned out the prices! Are you kidding me?! Tandri ends up handling that, which is supposed to establish her competency, but honestly...Viv hasn't figured out how much she needs to charge to cover the costs of supplies and labor? Basically two days later people are starting to love coffee, especially a...rat guy who is covered in flour every time he comes in. A week later they ask him \"hey, do you know anything about baking? Sure would be great to offer some baked goods,\" and literally the next DAY he's invented cinnamon buns, and is baking them for their coffee shop. Everyone goes crazy for them, and within a month he has invented biscotti and chocolate croissants, and the whole town is beating down the door for these baked goods. I'm not kidding. One month. Because at the end of the month is when Viv is supposed to pay her shake down fee to the local mafia lord, The Madrigal.<br /><br />Ok, finally, the minuscule stakes of this story unfold, right? The Madrigal is supposed to have the whole town in a choke hold. Cross this person, and Viv might lose everything. She calls in her old adventuring team, then proceeds to have the most frustrating conversation of the whole book. The team asks what Viv wants them to do. Help her fight? Scare the Madrigal? Put an end to the Madrigal altogether? Viv stammers...apparently she has no idea. She hasn't thought this far ahead before asking them to drop everything they're doing to come help her! Tandri steps in to speak on Viv's behalf, and explains to the team that NO, Viv can't possibly resort to violence, because she left that life behind, and if she uses violence now, she might never stop! <br /><br />Um...this has NEVER been mentioned before. Viv has not said any of this. And she has seemed perfectly comfortable with the idea of using violence to defend herself this entire time. All of a sudden violence is basically drugs and if she ever uses a sword again it will spoil everything forever? This is ridiculous. It came out of nowhere. And Viv just...accepts it as true. So her team is naturally like \"then...why did you call us here?!\" And she truly doesn't know. She didn't think it through, but it really just feels like the author didn't think it through. <br /><br />The whole premise of this story is that Viv has a lucky rock buried under her coffee shop, and this deus ex machina magically explains away why the author gets to put everything she needs right in her path. But the end result is that we just watch Viv open an immediately successful coffee shop, have no obstacles of any kind, have very few thoughts or feelings, and then suddenly she's having these huge emotional declarations about thoughts and feelings we have seen no hint of until they're declared. Those moments aren't just unearned, they don't fit. They haven't been established, and they even contradict things we've seen earlier sometimes. I won't spoil the other moments that set me off, but I will say that they were horribly frustrating each and every time they came up. <br /><br />Viv does eventually face some adversity and challenge...in the final 20% of the book...and it WAS finally interesting. Viv got to have actual thoughts and emotions (note, we don't actually get to read those thoughts or emotions, but we see them in her actions, and she actually has a conversation or two about them, so we know they exist.), which was nice, but the book had lost me so badly by that point. Cute or gimmicky side characters and the evolution of the menu just couldn't save it for me. Using the lucky rock to explain why Viv never had to use her brains or skills for anything is an unsatisfying plot device that really robs its characters of a chance to shine and show us who they are. Giving those characters no thoughts, and only very basic actions further keeps them very one dimensional. And not allowing any natural romance to develop between your love interests...it just denied our characters another chance to be interesting. The whole experience left me feeling so empty. <br /><br />But hey, at least there was a giant cat."

      "review": "This was a very quick, easy read. I was able to get through it in just a few days and enjoyed every moment of it. It was an especially welcome mental cleanser after finishing an emotionally exhausting, incredibly heavy book. <br /><br />None of the characters are particularly deep or interesting, but they're all very likable and easy to sympathize with. Viv’s dream of wanting to go from a life of violence and bloodshed to a peaceful life of operating a coffee shop is quirky, yet it makes her easy to root for. I even felt quite proud of her when Viv decided against turning back to violence, even when it seemed like her dream had failed.<br /><br />The romance in this story is simple but sweet. Again, it's not gone into in depth yet I appreciate that the author kept it tasteful. Unfortunately, a lot of male authors can fetishize queer female romances. That's not the case here, as the two truly did act like equals who were finding love for the first time. I'm rooting for them.<br /><br />Other side characters are quirky and colorful. As a baker, my favorite is Thimble. Though I do wonder how he deals with fur getting everywhere… With him, I can definitely sympathize with not having a large enough kitchen to do all the baking you want.<br /><br />I wish the world was fleshed out a little bit more, yet I also understand that that's not really the point of this book. I enjoyed what I got, and I hope I get more by reading the prequel eventually.<br />"

      "review": "I started listening to this one b/c I was migraining (thx, Mirena) and Kirsten and Patricia recommended it as light but also engaging and v sweet. Overall easy to listen to and perfect for when feeling miserable. They were 100% correct! It’s a lovely story that I enjoyed very much.<br /><br />I listened to this via BARD so no bookmarked quotes. Here are the thoughts I recorded as I listened, though.<br /><br />@2h13 - shades of Schitt's Creek! They’re doing a soft launch just like Rose Apothecary.<br /><br />@3h18 - I don't like how the main characters sneer at the annoying researcher man when he says he doesn't eat flour (or something like that). This is the only part of the book so far that is NOT sweet and accepting and lovely and wonderful. Instead of honoring their patron’s boundaries they bully him into buying baked goods (they’ve done twice now!) and then they tell him he'd better eat them. Not cool!!!<br /><br />To complicate things - not only do the characters misbehave but in the course of the book the man with the food restrictions ends up eating some of the baked goods and not getting sick! Which suggests that people with dietary restrictions are being overly sensitive or finicky, and/or that dietary restrictions are PREFERENCES rather than medical necessities. It’s a damaging, small-minded, and painful portrayal.<br /><br />@4h02 - typing this at 4h in but the comment itself has nothing to do with this point in the book; it’s just something I was thinking about while working on last night’s Sleep Log entry. Other than the bigotry demonstrated toward people with food restrictions this is such a lovely world to inhabit! The characters are delightful and full of - love? - for each other. They help each other out in the kindest and gentlest ways. The safe and supportive world is another way this story is similar to Schitt’s Creek. Also similar: I'm anticipating that Viv and Tandri are going to hook up, just like David and Patrick.<br /><br />Also - the narrator (who is also the author) is PHENOMENAL!! In addition to being a writer he’s also a professional audiobook narrator so that background / experience makes a difference for sure. But WOW he's talented and a pleasure to listen to!<br /><br />@4h18 - another Schitt's Creek similarity! Viv and Tandri are going on a date but the pretense is a \"celebration,” just like Patrick and David’s first date which Patrick *sold* as birthday celebration for David. Just like with Patrick and David this date was initiated by Tandri (the not-main character)... Except UNLIKE in Schitt’s Creek Viv and Tandri didn’t get together. Maybe because they didn’t have a Stevie to interrupt the date and explain to Viv (David) what was happening so she could recognize and respond appropriately to Tandri’s romantic overtures! The hob, Cal, *sort of* played that role, but MUCH less directly and not during the date itself.<br /><br />Here’s yet another similarity to Schitt’s Creek, though: like the Roses Viv is an outsider who's moved into a new community where she not only opens a shop that becomes a community center / gathering place, but she also finds acceptance and family in her new home. Also like the Roses she leaves behind her previous identity and ways of being in the world to become a different version of herself (this is one of the main themes of the book - that something / someone can start off in one way and then change into something / someone else).<br /><br />@6h17 - there’s only 7 mins left in the book so I don’t have high expectations for anything especially romantic to happen between Tandri and Viv. Especially because Viv is giving Tandri her own room (with her own BED?!). I’m confused by this. If they’re going to be a couple why wouldn’t they share a bed?? I feel like it’s sending mixed signals? (Unless it’s a Rob and Laura Petrie situation on steroids - not just twin beds in the same bedroom but twin beds in different rooms altogether?)<br /><br />A few mins later - I mean... I *guess* they've sort of been \"courting\" each other for a while? But to go from \"sort of having a crush but we don’t talk abt it\" to \"here's a bedroom; pls move in w me\" - it's an awfully big leap. I don’t buy it! Which makes me wonder if I’m missing something!"

      "review": "<br />I adored this book. It does cosy fantasy excellently, without losing the sense of being immerse in a different world. <br /><br />First and foremost the writing was very enjoyable. It wasn't particularly dense, but still descriptive and rich, and appropriately humorous where it was needed. I definitely got strong DnD vibes, though I think the author has mentioned that they themself have not played much DnD, just helped design games in similar worlds. I was a bit nervous reading a book about sapphic women written by a man, as historically thats had some issues, but I had no issues with Baldree's writing of women. I know someone I was buddy reading this with mentioned he excessively uses 'the woman' when referring to Tandri, to the point that it felt a bit out of place.<br /><br />The characters were heartwarming, I genuinely adored them and was rooting for them every step of the way. All had distinct voices and motivations that were similar enough that you can see why they were brought together. The only place this falls a bit flat is with the antagonists. <input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"spoiler__control\" aria-label=\"The following text has been marked spoiler.

I understand the intention and the bounds of cozy fantasy, but it left tension hanging and no way to deal with it. It felt strange. Fennus fared a lot better, until the epilogue. Tandri's message of nonviolent resolution and finding a way to live without permanently ridding the world of your enemy is immediately thrown out the window for a comedic scene of Fennus getting his butt handed to him by a dire cat. Making it so light hearted also undermined him as a villain - the damage he did to Viv and her dream feels less weighty, somehow. I much preferred the vague, ominous sense the Scalvert's stone brought that he would reap what he sowed in a more subtler sense. </label><br /><br />The romance wasn't as much of a focus as I thought it was going into it, but that's not a bad thing. It was sweet, and there were some really beautiful moments between the main couple. I would have preferred if there was more lead up, and some fluffy padding, as it seems to happen rather suddenly. But 'dollop of romantic froth' on top does seem to describe the romance well. <br /><br />I liked the way the plot unfolded and the mystery of <input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"spoiler__control\" aria-label=\"The following text has been marked spoiler.

Each bit felt progressive, and yet there was a tension to it because of its rocky foundations. The pay off was excellent. <input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"spoiler__control\" aria-label=\"The following text has been marked spoiler.

And up to the loss of the stone, Viv's constant fear and imposter syndrome regarding her success and her friends carry over to the reader - you are genuinely worried she will lose it all and more as soon as that stone is gone. The later discovery of what the Scalvert's stone actually does is well done, I feel, and the ominous fate left to Fennus (Despite later being undermined) was a great way to end a villain. </label><br /><br />Overall, I am very glad I bought a hard copy, as this is now one of my favourites and one I believe I will reread when I want to feel the cosiness of Viv's coffee shop again. <br /><br /><i>Read as part of a buddy read for the Reading Rainbow Discord server (eqeuR9k9Tp). </i>"

This does not affect my opinion of the book.* </i><br /><br /> - Pacing: fast<br /> - Character driven<br /> - Single POV<br /> - Sapphic MC<br /> - Slowburn F/F romance<br /> - Found family trope<br /><br />Reading Legends and Lattes felt like sitting down in a coffee shop for the first time. I loved how this cozy fantasy celebrated the small pleasures in life, and how they can bring people together. It is truly the best novel to read while wrapped in warm blankets and enjoying your favorite hot drink.<br /><br /><b>Characters</b><br />The main character, Viv, was such a fun character to follow. I liked the contrast of her intimidating exterior and violent past compared to her soft dream of opening a coffee shop. It was such a pleasure getting to see Viv make connections throughout the story. By the end, I felt like I’d make new friends. In some parts of the book, we got to meet Viv’s friends from her past life as a mercenary. Despite having little time in the story, the author was able to bring their personalities to life. I found myself wishing there was a prequel just so I could read more about them and Viv’s adventures together.<br /><br /><b>Worldbuilding</b><br />Since the book was fairly short for a fantasy novel, there wasn’t a lot of worldbuilding. I thought this was a wise choice for this type of story because worldbuilding tends to be tedious unless it is immediately relevant to the plot. The details the author did include about the fantasy world tended to be about the food and culture of different fantasy races, which I enjoyed learning about.<br /><br />Interestingly, the lack of worldbuilding gave the story an almost contemporary feel. I think this would be a great book to recommend to a contemporary fan who wants to try out fantasy or to a fantasy fan who wants something that reads more like a contemporary novel.<br /><br /><b>Writing Style</b><br />I really enjoyed the author’s writing style in this book. They gave such vivid descriptions of the coffee shop, its atmosphere, and the experience of trying coffee and pastries for the first time. The story felt like a celebration of life’s simple pleasures.<br /><br />Another thing I really liked about the author’s writing choices was that he left Viv’s past somewhat ambiguous. She mentions killing people and taking up various jobs for money, so it’s safe to assume she worked as a mercenary; however, she only mentions these things in passing. They never become the focus of the narrative, reinforcing the idea that the Viv we meet in the story is separate from her past. She’s already been reborn.<br /><br /><b>You’ll Like This Book if You Enjoy…</b><br /> - Coffee shops<br /> - Books that make you appreciate the small things<br /> - Found family trope<br /> - Stories about self-reinvention<br /> - Books that feel like a warm hug<br /> - Stories about everyday life with just a touch of magic<br /> <i>*Disclaimer: this book is best enjoyed while sipping a latte*</i><br /><br />More reviews like this at <a href=\"https://wordwilderness.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Word Wilderness</a>"

      "review": "listen, this book is just so cute. a sapphic orc leaves her life of fighting behind to open a coffeeshop with a random succubus who responds to the job ad she posts on the street. eventually, they also have a rat that bakes cinnamon rolls, a giant cat, and a punk rock bard. i cannot help it, i am charmed.<br /><br />i’ve seen criticisms from people who didn’t like how basic the plot is, the lack of any real worldbuilding (it’s just a generic D&amp;D fantasy world), or the simple writing style. they’re not wrong; don’t go into this looking for a literary masterpiece. but that’s not really the point of this book. the best books are experiences, and this book succeeds in immersing me in the experience of living out a fluffy queer coffeeshop adventure with a bunch of fantasy characters. i don’t need worldbuilding from this and i barely need plot. i got JUST enough of both to support the coffee shop shenanigans. (and knowing what to prioritize in your fiction in order to accomplish the thing you set out to accomplish is very much the mark of a skilled storyteller!)<br /><br />HIGHLY recommend the audiobook, which really brings the characters to life. …and i just now went to look up the name of the narrator, and it turns out the author narrated it! so that’s extra cool."

      "review": "I really enjoyed this cozy read. It was like curling up with a bit cup of coffee. But, even as a queer person, I thought the male dungeon Master wet dream of having a lesbian succubus was seriously unnecessary to the story line. Friendship is no less valuable or a less important kind of love. We didn't need romance. We didn't need Viv and Tandri to be lesbians. It added nothing to their characters or to the storyline itself. A focus on friendship would have been far more valuable. I give this book a 3.75 out of five instead of a solid four for that reason, and i give it a four because I only give five to books I'd reread. I wouldn't reread this book."

      "review": "A warm hug of a book that also keeps you on your toes!<br />I'll miss my trips to my favourite coffee shop and the magical characters that lie within!<br />Also, Viv you are my spirit animal ♥️♥️♥️<br /><br />My reading notes:<br /><br />Chapter 1 - Finding the building and burying Scalvert Stone<br />Chapter 2 - Finding the Hob to help with the renovation <br />Chapter 3 - Viv and the Hob gutted the building. First mention of the Madrigal. <br />Chapter 4 - More renovations, the Café is taking shape! Lack reappears. Viv gets bought a stove by Cal and they both try the coffee for the first time.<br />\"Ladies stockings and exotic bean water. Gods help us.\" <br />Chapter 5 - Building work is done! Viv is fidgety waiting for the coffee machine. She puts out an ad for an assistant and in less than 7 hours Tandri, a Succubus with a VERY queer vibe turns up! Not very experienced but keen to learn...and not patient. Pretty much is hired straight away leaving Viv baffled. That night Viv hears a sound on her roof...second time this has happened...but no one there...<br />Chapter 6 - Viv and Tandri go shopping for things for the interior of the shop and crockery etc. When they get back they find Roon, the Dwarf from her old party, and the coffee machine! They catch up and he gives her a blink stone before leaving. Viv and Tandri test out the coffee machine with great results. <br />Chapter 7 - Viv gets everyone to try lattes. They all love it. Cal gifts Viv a sign for the Café. They decide to open tomorrow but Tandri worries about customers. Laney gave them an inedible cake. Cal says his work is done and leaves. Viv and Tandri preparing for opening. Are they flirting? She hangs a garland on Blackblood. Viv checks the Scalvert Stone. Tandri went to leave. Someone took the discarded cake from outside the cafe....who?<br />Chapter 8: Tandri was right. No customers came...apart from Cal and Laney who didn't drink her latte. Tandri decided to make signs and offer free samples for the next day. The two defo have romantic tension! At the end of the day Lack reappeared with the Gatewarden. Viv is anxious. <br />Chapter 9 - They opened up with free samples. Business was busy for the morning including an adorable Ratkin...then it slowed. A student came and sat in for hours. Viv and Tandri got fidgety. Viv went and bought a slate that Tandri decorated. They'd have to wait to see what tomorrow would bring...<br />Chapter 10: Got a few repeat customers including the ratkin...and the student. He was investigating the ley lines which made Viv anxious. They put up a sign saying it was for customers only...but it did spark the idea.. Cals idea...to serve food. As she went back a massive dire-cat appeared on the floor! They moved her to the corner...at least the Dwarf thought it was a she...he wasn't going to check! Fennus appeared...her old party member but they didn't get on. He made comments referring to the Scalvert Stone...the direcat scared him off. Tandri called her Amity<br />Chapter 11 - First day of paid business! Things were busy...apart from the afternoon and even Hemington paid. Tandris ex...one sided love interest appeared and with the help of Amity they scared him off...but he did mention the Madrigal. Thimble the ratkin was approached by Viv. The next day he appeared with a huge cinnamon roll type thing and it was...orgasmic. he was hired to bake there every day for 4 silvers and the promise of free coffee <br />Chapter 12- Thimble turned up for work. He and Viv set out to buy everything that he needed. They started selling buns that afternoon and they sold out within 30 wins! Tandri was disappointed and Laney would be too...Thimble happily began a second batch. <br />Chapter 13 - Things are getting busy at the Café! Rolls sell out very quickly so poor Thimble is working relentlessly. Cal is on a mission though. In this Chapter there is also Pendry who...tried.. to perform at the cafe and a gnome that Tandri said was playing chess...by himself. <br />Chapter 14: Thimble required some new ingredients and created Thimblets. Cal returned with his plans for a cooling system. They closed for a day to install it.<br /> Chapter 15: The shop was open again after the renovation. Viv felt settled and proud. Pendry the bard was back and much better than previously. Hemington returned and asked to set up a ward - Viv was worried this would uncover the Scalvert Stone. Lack, Kellin and others reappeared startling both women. Tandri said Viv needed to care for herself more than the Café. Vib threw the Blink Stone into the fire to summon her old party. She couldn't settle.<br />Favourite quote: \"Shut up you insufferable shitweasel!\" (P. 140)<br />Chapter 16: Taivus, Roon and Gallina arrived 3 days later. They were fed and watered and then Viv mentioned the Madrigal. Tandri thinks Viv should pay get over it and leave her old life behind. Viv can't do that just yet. Gallina is adorable and wants to fight but Taivus says he knows them and will arrange a meeting. Amity turns up and spooks them but Gallina gives her a roll. Tandri apologies for speaking on Vivs behalf but Viv says she was bang on the money.<br />Chapter 17: The Gnome playing solo chess returned and Amity sat under his table. Pendry came back and performed well. Viv gave him a coffee and said he should try being more adventurous again. Cal came in and told Viv to stop and make sure she sees it...whatever that means. Viv and Gallina went out for dinner. Gallina thinks Viv should use violence with the Madrigal - Viv rejects the offer. They go back to the cafe and Tandri tells Viv she should be more wary - that something may be up. Vib tells her she is used to protecting herself. Viv tells Tandri home then walks around for a while alone in the darkness.<br />Chapter 18: Viv had her meeting with the Madrigal. It was not at all like she expected. The Madrigal knows about the Scalvert Stone but does not seem to want it. Viv still refuses to pay the monthly dues. The Madrigal makes Viv an offer which she agrees to...what could this be?<br />Chapter 19: Viv tells Tandri all about the Scalvert Stone and even shows it to her. The deal with the Madrigal is now weekly in cinnamon rolls. Viv is wary that Fennus may be involved with the Madrigal...but hopes that see will turn against him seeing as she hates arseholes. Thimble turns up to work with ice in hand. This gives Viv the idea for iced drinks...which she uses to make a deal with Hemington. Kellin returns and Viv gets rid of him by telling him of her deal. That evening they add iced drinks to the menu. Viv has a deep sense of foreboding...is Fennus lurking round the corner?<br />Chapter 20: A really cosy little chapter! Started with Viv chatting with the chess playing gnome who we find out is called Durias. He answers Viv's questions...but she is left confused over the answers. Thimble discovers chocolate and shares it with the women - who knows what he will add to the menu next! Kellin turns up but is shortly sent packing after collecting treats for the Madrigal. Finally, Tandri invites Viv out on a little date. They have an evening picnic near Ackers where Tandri opens up about her past to which Viv replies \"Fuck those motherfuckers!\" After a sweet evening, Viv walks Tandri home then before she can say anything, the Orc wishes the Succubus goodnight.<br />Chapter 21: There was tension between Viv and Tandri this whole chapter. The two women clearly have feelings for each other but either knows how to act upon them. Thimble unveiled his new creation 'Midnight Crescents' and they were an instant success. Hemington came back and, in return for a free iced latte, set up the ward for Viv. She was told that she would get a small tug in her hand when or if it was disturbed. For a week there was nothing...Viv soon forgot it was there. Pendry also returned and his original unique sound was much improved. Amity also visited the cafe more regularly and often hid up in the rafters like a gargoyle watching the customers below. Laney also kept asking Thimble for his recipes...but to now avail. Tandri suggested they sell mugs so people can have their own and take their drinks with them. Viv loved this idea and Tandri was really started to make the cafe her own. Viv tried to pay her a compliment but it was poorly delivered...so the women backed away and got on with things. Talk about slow burn romance!!<br />Chapter 22: Viv ordered a new stove for Thimble. Lack reappeared to collect the Madrigals pastries. A girl came in looking for Pendry - third one that week! The next time he came to the Café Viv offered him a contract to perform 4 times a week. The ward was distributed! Vivs aching hand was proof of that. Fennus was in the Café looking for the stone claiming Viv had cheated and wronged him! During their exchanged Amity appeared unseen and scared Fennus off. She then finally curled up on the blankets Viv had set out for her. Since when had his happened! Viv checked the Stone. It was still there...but for how long?? She started to contemplate what would happen if she lost the stone. Would everything she'd achieved wither away? Where would she be then? Alone.<br />Chapter 23: Viv filled Tandri in on what had happened with Fennus. The gravity of what they might lose if they stone has gone hit them both (and their hidden feelings) even more so when Tandri mentioned thaumistry and the potential for bad luck of sorts (Arcane Reciprocity). Viv was highly anxious and irritable but it faded overtime and things slowly went back to normal. After 3 weeks the Madrigal came to the Café and warned that action from Fennus may be imminent. Tandri insisted she stay with Viv as she could detect disregularity but Viv was resistant. She begrudgingly accepted...not like she had a choice...and once they were both asleep together on the sorry excuse for a bed Viv realised that actually she was grateful.<br />Chapter 24: Wow! I'm glad I was sat down when I read this Chapter! What started off as a sweet uneventful Chapter where the two ladies went about their business enjoying each others company and dreaming up future plans for the Café ended in disaster! Viv and Tandri were awoken by Amity on top of them warning them of the danger that lurked below. The whole Café was engulfed in green spectral flame! Viv got the three of them out and to safety and also saved the lockbox and coffee machine. She didn't have time to check on the Scalvert Stone. They had lost everything they had worked hard on. But at least they had each other.<br />Chapter 25: Aftermath of the fire. Both women are feeling the affect of the fire and Viv is badly burnt. The Scalvert Stone is gone...unsurprisingly...and Blackblood is destroyed. Tandri has done her best to support Viv but understandably both women are broken and grieving. Viv is now staying with Tandri. <br />\"She'd forsworn her old life, crossing a bridge to a new land, and now knelt in its ruin. This (Blackblood) was the bridge burning away behind her, leaving her in a desolation\"<br />Chapter 26: At the start of the chapter Viv is, understandably, in a deep depression. Cal and Tandri are keen to help rebuild the cafe but Viv yells, she sees no point! She has nothing left so may as well run away and never look back. Cal leaves and Viv is left alone with Tandri. Tandri reminds Viv of her words after the fire - at least we didn't lose everything. Tandri tells Viv she knew exactly what she meant and the pair share a single sweet kiss. The rest of the chapter consists of Tandri, Viv and Cal starting to clear and rebuild, the support of the others helps Viv she is not unwise to do this even if others may think so. Pendry offers his help too with heavy lifting and Hem offers to set up a ward and protection against fire, Viv agrees. Viv tries to keep her eyes off Tandri as they work but can't help it, she thought she looked pretty radiant even while covered in streaks of grey and in a workers shirt. Maybe there was good luck still here after all, even without the Stone being present. This chapter made my heart happy!<br />Chapter 27: Viv and Cal get to work building the shop with Pendry and Tandri helping. Viv is blown away by the generosity of the community in providing building materials and even has a delivery from the Madrigal. Durias appears to say he is glad that she is staying around and then tells her that the Scalvert Stone is not what she thought it was. The ring of fortune the stone promised actually referred to people and if that is the case then it had worked a treat! Durias offered his congratulations to Viv and Tandri...and for the shop rebuilding. Amity of course appeared to see her friend. Later after the work has continued for a while Gallina and Roon arrive with TWO NEW OVENS donated for the Cafe which was organised for Viv by her girl...this perplexes Viv but we all know what this means! Gallina suggests finding Fennus and taking a finger...or three...but Viv says if he has the stone he will get what's coming to him. Viv promises Gallina a sackful of rolls when the reopen.<br />Chapter 28: Re-opening day! Viv and Tandri both scurry off with secret plans - I suspect Viv's involves actually having living quarters which is such great character development!! Viv takes a secret delivery before Tandri and Cal arrive. They surprise her with a refurbished shop sign which has the remains of Blackblood on it! Viv is still able to hold on to who she was as she moves forward to the future - its a beautiful gesture. The cafe re-opens with a new menu and a big crowd! Thimble is hard at work with his two new ovens. All the familiar faces are back. Pendry is back playing on his new stage, Hem arrives and actually orders a hot drink and the Madrigal offers her congratulations in person then leaves with a big bag of pastries. The cafe is alive and full of life again. Durias comes back without his chess board and in his perfectly cryptic way tells the ladies everything will work out Ok...and the Cafe too.<br />Final note: I am in love with the new Cafe slogan! From 'Finer tastes for the working gent and lady' to ''What Flames Could Not Consume, Never Shall Be Extinguished.'<br />Chapter 29: It's the end of the first day of being open. There is a quiet hum in the Cafe as everyone winds down after a busy day. Viv gets a scroll from the new living quarters and addresses her three co-workers. She tells them she is so grateful for them and doesn't deserve their kindness. \"So I might not deserve you. And you might forgive too much. But I'm damned glad to have you.\" She presents them with co-ownership deeds and they all sign...even if Cal is begrudging. They share a drink and toast \"to what the flames could not consume.\" Cal and Thimble leave but Viv asks Tandri to stay. She shows her the room she has made with a bed...and there's a room for Tandri also with all her art supplies! Viv doesn't need to ask Tandri if she'll move in. The hug and kiss they share are enough of an answer for the both of them. So cute I am in love but I am going to miss my favourite little coffee shop.<br /><br />Epilogue: Fennus is still lurking around. He sees Viv is thriving even without the stone...maybe none of this was worth it. He is about to flee when Lack corners him. Lack scales the wall trying to escape but he is quickly found by Amity. He has a split second to wonder if it was the same god-damned cat from before...then Amity leaps."

And also I read that this read very fanfic-y and I haven't had a good track record with books that felt that way to me.<br /><br />HOWEVER!! I had a surprisingly really good experience! I really loved seeing Viv build up both her business and her relationships. It was so nice seeing so many people do their best in helping her. Also I think the queer romance was done very well and was very sweet (surprising agin, since this book had a male author). <br /><br />If this author ever came out with more books I'd definitely pick them up and I'll be sure to be on the lookout for more cozy fantasies in general in the future :)"

I was ready to embark in an adventure that had all the fantasy elements without any fear or anxiety, I wanted to dive into a book where my favorite characters would be okay. However, that is the thing, I did not have any favorite character, since the author did not make anyone interesting.<br /><br />I knew that this was a queer romance, and that excited me, but there was no romance whatsoever. That was not that big of ideal for me, since this book was supposed to be all about friendships, and I love friendships, but the book failed me again. Everything was too superficial, we were just expected to like all the characters together, even though they did not even talk to each other much.<br /><br />It was not bad but it was not good either."

Simple story line, simple characters, feel good story, a little bit of romance. I loved the creativity behind the coffee shop, I am obsessed with Thimble, and I like that it isn't blatant queer-baiting (although.. you kinda knew what was coming, but it was a mere super-super-tiny-sideplot). <br /><br />I didn't do this in audio - but I believe it's read by the author and I can only imagine how wonderful it is for audio. <br /><br />I would absolutely recommend this book and I cannot wait until #2 comes out.

The setting is fairly insulated, so despite taking place in a big city, the book didn’t overwhelm you with too much lore. The author trusts that you have a cursory knowledge of the typical fantasy tropes.<br /><br />The emotions and problems the characters face are depicted in a way that is realistic and believable, the characters are fun and unique, and the story is hopeful and, as it says on the cover, kind. <br /><br />A cute, cozy, queer romance. 5/5"

      "review": "<u>\n  <b>All the stars in the universe/5</b>\n</u><br />This book feels like a warm hug, and it's so perfect I could die. I love it so much.<br /><br /><b>\"Things don’t have to stay as what they started out as.\"</b><br /><br />This was my second time reading this book and I will have to say... It is as good, if not better than the first time around. I had never, before reading this book, experienced a book this cozy. I mean, the vibes, the descriptions of the pastries, the relationships between the characters... It's such a perfect book. And it's one of my favourite books. Considering I only have 4 favourites at the moment, I would say it counts for something.<br /><br /><b>\"It was like drinking the feeling of being peaceful. Being peaceful in your mind. Well, not if you have too much, then it’s something else.\"</b><br /><br />The vibes are immaculate. Who wouldn't want to read about an ogre building from scratch a cafe, described to smell like cinnamon rolls and fresh coffee... That's right nobody. I will say, the action is very slow. If you want to read this book, I would 100% recommend doing so by listening to the audiobook. The author narrates it beautifully and you can sense he loves his book a lot. I have heard that people reading it normally find it a little boring, because it has very low stakes, so if you want my advice, I would definitely suggest giving the audiobook a shot !<br /><br /><b>\"She was smiling, and for the first time, the building, the city, this place… felt like hers. A place she’d still be tomorrow, the week after, next season, next year…. Home.\"</b><br /><br />The writing in this book is beautiful. The way the author describes the food, the tastes and smells, and the atmosphere of the cafe... It made it feel like I was there, alongside Viv and Tandri, in a little booth, sipping a latte. I wish I could teleport to their world, and experience how magical this place really is. I found that the author wrote their characters in a way that was very much in detail, making you grow extremely fond of every single one.<br /><br /><b>\"The combined aromas of hot cinnamon, ground coffee, and sweet cardamom intoxicated her, and as she brewed and smiled and served and chatted, a deep contentment welled up. It was a glowing warmth she’d never experienced before, and she liked it. She liked it a great deal.\"</b><br /><br />Whilst romance wasn't at all the center of the book, the little sprinkle the author added between Viv and Tandri was absolutely amazing. It felt right, and beautiful. And let's not forget the amazing found family trope. I mean, if you like found family, you will be more than satisfied with this one. It offers everything and more. And oh god, I love Thimble with all my heart, he is the cutest little creature and such a great character to have in the story.<br /><br /><b>\"So. I might not deserve you. And you might forgive too much. But I’m damned glad to have you.\"</b><br /><br />Whilst the story is mainly slow and doesn't have much other than the café, I felt that it didn't miss everything. There was a bit more action at some moments, especially towards the end, but I found that even without, this book would still be perfect without it. In a few words, this book is magical and I wouldn't change a single part of it. My review is messy but I just can't put into words how much I love it.<br /><br /><b>\"WHAT FLAMES COULD NOT CONSUME, NEVER SHALL BE EXTINGUISHED.\"</b>"

      "review": "2.5 Stars<br /><br />I think the best way I've heard this book described is \"perfectly whatever.\" It's hard to say what is wrong with it; I would say stuff happens, but it <i>feels</i> like nothing happens.<br /><br />Everything that is said about it, I'd respond with \"technically yes, but...\"<br /><br />1. \"It's cozy fantasy!\"<br />Umm... technically true. This is a story about an adventurer settling down and opening a coffee shop. Cool. But the focus was always in the wrong place to make this premise work. There needed be more better atmospheric writing to help sell me on this coffee shop, more flavor as it were. Time spent building the shop should also have been spent building the relationships between the characters. But instead they just build the shop. No vibes.<br /><br />Also, in the end, this story had nothing to say. <br /><br />2. \"It's low stakes!\"<br />True, but not done well. The appropriate level stakes related to the coffee shop were glossed over or easily resolved. Like finding a customer base for an exotic drink or winning over the neighbors or dealing with a kingpin without resorting to violence. But then they keep giving me higher stakes with the Scalvert stone and the guy who wants to steal it. Then they treat the high stakes with the same approach as the low stakes. <input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"spoiler__control\" aria-label=\"The following text has been marked spoiler. Toggle checkbox to reveal or hide.\" onchange=\"this.labels[0].setAttribute('aria-hidden', !this.checked);\" id=\"1d2ca7d2-5f63-4bda-94da-50bc6d1ffc52\" /><label aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"spoiler\" for=\"1d2ca7d2-5f63-4bda-94da-50bc6d1ffc52\">When the Madrigal warns Viv that something bad was going to happen that night, she doesn't have Hem reinstall the warning spell. Tandri insists on staying, but that doesn't help anything. They didn't move the Scalvert stone to a different place or a safer place. Viv had been warned several times by different people that her shop was vulnerable to fire. Why didn't she find a spell or something to make it flame resistant? She literally does nothing about the threat. I needed something else. Like maybe the neighbors come together to protect the shop, instead of helping rebuild it after it burns down. I also thought Viv might carry on with a coffee cart instead of cafe.</label><br /><br /><br />3. \"It's found family!\" <br />Eh. It's found coworkers at best. The heart of this book should have been the characters, but it wasn't. It was severely lacking in character connections and character interactions. Theoretically, it had all of the elements. You had Cal and Tandri and Thimble and the direcat and Pendry, not to mention the secondary characters. This needed to channel stronger slice-of-life vibes and fewer \"I play Dungeons and Dragons\" vibes to put the focus for this type of story in the correct place. There's not much plot, which needed to be balanced by really compelling/charismatic/heartwarming characters.<br /><br />Viv took a backseat to her dream after a certain point. Any improvements or forward momentum to the cafe was done by other characters. Tandri did all the marketing and business strategies. Thimble starts as a customer, then becomes the baker, which really solidifies the success of the cafe. Viv became an observer.<br /><br />4. \"It has a dollop of romance!\"<br />See above. There were not enough interactions between Viv and Tandri to make me believe they were falling in love. When Tandri says Viv shouldn't use violence to deal with the Madrigal, it kind of comes out of nowhere that Tandri would have such strong opinions about Viv using violence. There was little to no evidence to support their romance.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />I can see what the author was going for, but I didn't get there. Shame on me for getting suckered by overhyp. Particularly of the self-published variety. I think this book could have truly been a cozy fantasy with low stakes and found family and a dollop of romance with the help of an editor and a few more drafts."

      "review": "Coffee-loving D &amp; D fans might enjoy this book, but be warned - nothing much happens! It’s an off-beat fantasy, light on action and adventure, but big on heart. <br />I listened to the audiobook and loved the author’s narration. He has a voice that is wonderfully rich to listen to.<br />The story centres on Viv, a 7ft tall Orc swordswoman, who retires from her gang of bounty-hunters to open a coffee shop. She’s lived a rough and violent life, and is riddled with self-doubt about whether she deserves to have a happy and successful retirement. To give herself a ‘fighting chance’, her last job involved tracking down and killing a ‘Scalvert queen’. She opted to take the Scalvert’s stone growing inside the queen’s head as her cut of the treasure booty. Rumour has it that a Scalvert’s stone will bring good fortune to its owner (although its power isn’t well understood). <br />Viv buries the Scalvert’s stone under the floor of the livery stable she buys in the town of Thune. She hires ‘hob’ Cal, a skilled carpenter, to transform the building into a cafe and advertises for staff. Tandri, a creative ‘succubus’, comes on board to help run the business, and a shy ‘ratkin’ named Thimble, who’s a ‘genius baker’, soon has customers queuing for his baked goods. Pendry, a talented but awkward musician provides regular entertainment, and even a huge stray ‘dire-cat’ named Amity calls the place ‘home’. It seems to be a sanctuary of sorts for oddball or outcast characters.<br />The coffee-shop soon wins the hearts and minds of the townsfolk, including the local ‘standover merchant’ named Madrigal, who accepts coffee and baked goods in lieu of protection money!<br />The only real threat is Fennus, one of Viv’s former gang members, who covets the Scalvert’s stone. One night, he steals the stone and sets fire to the shop, leaving it in ruins. This breaks Viv’s heart, but her friends and the townsfolk band together to help rebuild their beloved cafe. Even, though the Scalvert’s stone is gone, the business soon thrives once more. Regular customer Durius, a gnome magician, explains that the stone’s true power lies in bringing together like-minded people. Viv’s kind-heart and community spirit drew other helpers to her enterprise. The future doesn’t look so good for Fennus!<br />I enjoyed this story, despite the lack of action, and the muddled world-building. The setting seems to be a low tech, medieval type community, but the coffee-shop, with it’s coffee machine, cinnamon buns, biscotti, and even ‘keep-cups’ is a modern establishment! Cal even seems to build some sort of primitive air-conditioning and refrigeration system? If the author meant this to be tongue-in-cheek, it didn’t come across that way to me! I was also bemused when Viv was badly burned during the fire, but there’s no mention of medical treatment for her burns besides a wet cloth. Maybe Orc skin is robustly regenerative?<br />On the plus side, there’s a low-key, same-sex romance between Viv and Tandri which is sweet, and the friendship between all the main characters is the key strength of this novel.<br />The edition I listened to, included a prequel story. It tells the tale of how Viv researched the Scalvert’s stone and fell in love with coffee during a quest to capture a thieving dapplegrim. The story gives background to Viv and members of the band of mercenary hunters she fought with. These include Fennus, the cunning elf, Gallina, the resourceful gnome, Roon, the gruff but tender-hearted dwarf, and the mystic stone-fey Taivus.<br />I’m not a dungeons and dragons player so I had to look-up a lot of the fantasy character types in this book. Their special or magical skills weren’t a big feature of the story though, so it wasn’t problematic.<br />All in all, this story is a bit hit and miss, but I recommend the audiobook. It’s not long, and is a light, entertaining diversion from more complex reading material. "

I thought the coffee shop was hilarious, and I loved the way all of the baked goods were introduced and described. It felt like eating them all for the first time reading their descriptions. I was so jealous of the characters because I wanted to try them so badly, I would die for Thimble and for his baked goods🤣 I really loved the relationships in this story and how the friendships were built up in natural and steady ways. I loved seeing the ways that the author described the coffees, setting and of course the baked goods. They have an incredible skill to make me be able to smell and almost taste the things they described in this which really enhanced the whole atmosphere of this book. <br /><br />Viv is an absolute sweetheart and I love her. She was such a gentle giant and I wanted nothing more than for her to have her peaceful ending. I loved her insecurities and I loved seeing her grow in confidence with the people around her. I loved the slow build up of tension in this between Viv and Tandri. It was so cute the way they both weren’t sure but tried in this own little ways to hint at how they felt. I really liked that their romance was almost a background plot for this story and the friendships they both built took more centre stage. <br /><br />Nothing crazy happens in this story it’s very low stakes compared to a typical ‘fantasy’ but it was just as magical and almost refreshing in being able to enjoy the experience of being in a fantasy world without all the battles and bloodshed. However I also think it’s important to note that low stakes doesn’t mean nothing matters, for Viv the events of this story are very high stakes. She wants to leave her life or battle behind her and open this coffee shop, to her starting afresh and forging a new path are the most important things. Viv’s struggles are relatable and move the plot of this story along smoothly while keeping you engaged in wanting the best outcome for her. <br /><br />Cannot wait to explore more by this author and more in this genre ☕️🐉❤️"

Eager to start a fresh life, she opens the first-ever coffee shop in Thune. Despite her best wishes (and a little luck), life isn't as simple as lounging with a latte in hand. Old friends return as new foes while new rivals wish to profit off her success. As she tries to put her blade and bloodshed behind her, Viv finds herself surrounded by partners and, potentially, family.<br /><br />💜 Grab a freshly brewed cup of coffee, a flaky pastry oozing with chocolate, and surround yourself in the magic of Legends &amp; Lattes. It's absolutely no surprise that this book was a nominee for a Goodreads Choice Award under Best Fantasy. Legends &amp; Lattes is an easy yet delectable read. If you're looking for a cozy fantasy perfect for fall, this is it! Viv's perseverance is admirable, her desire for a better life relatable. On the surface level, this seems like a relaxing read about a woman who wants to open a coffee shop. When you dig a little further, the themes of community, found family, and above all else, acceptance resonate throughout every page. When you remove the fantasy elements, it's about taking a risk, starting life on a fresh page, and tackling the struggles you're bound to experience along the way. Every relationship is a reminder that it's never too late to find your tribe, to build a family from nothing but a dream and a few coffee beans. I adored Tandri, who starts as Viv's assistant but quickly becomes a friend, voice of reason, and reminder that Viv can't give up (and later, a little more than that).<br /><br />🦇 Since this is a cozy fantasy, each source of conflict is short-lived, never generating enough tension to really drive the story forward. I preferred Viv's internal conflicts--her guilt for leaving her old crew, the disbelief that she can rebuild and try again--than the external \"villains\" who try to bar her progress. What's perhaps most disappointing is the lack of world-building, despite this occurring in a fantasy setting. Despite that, the prose transports you to the Legends &amp; Lattes coffeehouse, urges you to breathe in the scent of dark roast brewing and mouth-watering pastries baking (yes, I was craving coffee and pastries the ENTIRE time I read this), and encourages you to sit back, relax, and enjoy.<br /><br />❝ “WHAT FLAMES COULD NOT CONSUME, NEVER SHALL BE EXTINGUISHED” ❞<br /><br />🦇 Recommended to anyone looking for a cozy fantasy full of meaningful relationships. Despite the low-key fantasy elements, there's magic in this story. Grab that cup of coffee and dive in.<br /><br />✨ The Vibes ✨<br />☕ Found Family<br />☕ Cozy Fantasy<br />☕ Sapphic Romance<br />☕ Cafe Life<br />☕ Magical Creatures<br /><br />🦇 Major thanks to the author and publisher for providing an ARC of this book via Netgalley. 🥰 This does not affect my opinion regarding the book."

The setting is clearly fantastical but not overwhelming as most fantasy worlds are, the conflict is familiar overall and makes it a very easy read with no stress.<br /><br />So far not a great read, the modern aspects of the café (the latte, iced coffee, takeaway) felt very awkward when integrated into the fantastical setting, I had no emotional connection to any of the characters and the romance didn't really feel like a slow burn, it was barely burning, and the found family aspect felt more like found coworkers.<br />"

      "review": "Probably 3.5 stars, an okay read, kind of fun and cozy. I LOVE Becky Chambers, so I appreciate the appeal of cozy whatever, but this isn't really in the same league as Ms. Chambers.<br /><br />I do have to give it some credit, when I started I was put off by the whole orc-on-a-quest setting (I am not a huge fan of RPG-type fantasy because much of it feels quite derivative to me and lacking in character work), but the book won me over...somewhat. At least on the character front.<br /><br />I really liked that the main character was a female orc, and I did like the gradual introduction of the found family, which fleshed out the whole coffee shop venture nicely. But there was a lot that was extremely formulaic about the story. <br /><br />For example, as soon as the succubus showed up, it was clear that we had a Lesbian Romance a'brewing. That's all fine as it goes. <br /><br />But, unfortunately it felt extremely perfunctory and predictable. <br /><br />It felt like the author found a checklist somewhere geared exactly for under-50 authors who want to seem hip and get a lot of buzz on TicToc or whatever the latest app is. And by following this formula/recipe/outline, he could therefore sell a BUNCH of books to liberal Millennial and Post-Millenial crowds (and perhaps simultaneously piss off a lot of conservative crowds to generate even more publicity). So this guy did it. He followed a recipe.<br /><br />And about the number 2 or 3 ingredient in that current recipe seems to be the item: \"Establish same-sex romance.\"<br /><br />I guess it's not entirely bad that we're in a world where a same-sex romance is a predictable formulaic cliche, but I would rather a same-sex romance be beautiful and meaningful and illustrative of a larger theme. And it just wasn't here. It was the third ingredient in this formula to make a best-seller.<br /><br />That's just one example. <br /><br />Not to say this is a bad book, it's fun and I like how it sort of lightly tinkers with the cliches of the fantasy genre into coziness. It just doesn't compare well to Becky Chambers, who must have spoiled me."

As a queer bookworm who loves cafes, fantasy, and playing Dungeons &amp; Dragons with friends, this is the perfect book for me! I cannot recommend this enough; this is the kind of book I want to WRITE someday. What an inspiration. <br /><br />Reading \"Bookshops &amp; Bonedust\" or \"Legends &amp; Lattes\" in either chronological or publication order is up to personal preference. Taking epilogues and bonus content into account, however, if you want to read strictly in chronological order, then you would read: <br /><br />1. the \"Bookshops &amp; Bonedust\" main text <br />2. the bonus prequel content at the end of \"Legends &amp; Lattes\" <br />3. the \"Legends &amp; Lattes\" main text and epilogue <br />4. the \"Bookshops &amp; Bonedust\" epilogue <br /><br />Maybe in another year or two they'll publish a compendium edition with all the content in the above order. I'd certainly buy it! <br /><br />2023 REVIEW: <br /><br />This is for any fan of fantasy adventure, cozy fantasy stories, and especially those who play Dungeons &amp; Dragons. I'll be recommending this to all my friends! Also a cute lesbian romance subplot, so I read it during Pride Month 2023, and they are quite sweet. The plot isn't especially violent or unnecessarily complex, so I'll say anyone at late middle grade reading level or above could really enjoy this. <br /><br />The pacing, unique characters, and world building are all done so well. I am quite impressed by this book and couldn't put it down! This is a great spin on fantasy adventurers congregating around taverns by founding a thriving cafe and bakery scene in the city of Thune instead. <br /><br />Great premise, well executed. I'm thrilled to have read this and will think of Viv &amp; company whenever I frequent my favorite cafe (currently Simona Cafe in Clarendon, VA). My only gripe is that the romance should have started earlier and received more page time. There are like 2 maybe dates when there should've been an additional 2+ official dates in order for that ending to feel deserved. Oh, well. To the fan art and fan fiction with me! <br /><br />I read the edition with the bonus map and prequel story, which I enjoyed. What a debut! Tor Publishing and Barnes &amp; Nobles Booksellers wouldn't have breathed second life into this self-published work without the passionate readership it has acquired. I'm now a proud fan; its praise has been well won."

Together with Cal the Hobb, Tandri the succubus, and Thimble the rattkin, Viv watches as her wildest dream comes to life around her in a coffee scented delight.<br /><br />This book was everything. It was exactly what I needed and what I wanted. Low stakes, high adventure, a love letter to coffee and what happens after the final battle. I found all of the characters fleshed out, and the pacing slow and steady. The light dappling of queer romance thrown in were the extra sprinkles on top. Between strong female characters, just enough intrigue to keep me going, and evoking every single sensory image of a coffee shop (I'm craving cinnamon rolls now) this book is a delight from start to finish. <br /><br />Read if you like coffee shops, slow friendship, and finding yourself after all those year."

It was fun to have them describe basic things like coffee that we take for granted to characters who have never experienced it before. It was almost YA but they had to sprinkle in a few f words here and there to keep it relevant. <br /><br />It felt like not a lot happened in the book though..it was very low stakes. I saw someone post a review that it felt like diner dash because they kept upgrading the cafe and that made me laugh so hard because it's true! <br /><br />(Very slight spoiler ahead) <br />I think the storyline would have been more powerful if it was a friendship/found family story than trying to push a relationship just for the sake of adding \"romance\" without the actual romance. It felt kind of \"well we gotta put in a queer relationship to keep it relevant\" even though it wasn't super believable or compelling."

If you're looking for the blueprints for opening a Starbucks in a mediocre fantasy world with no electricity, then this is your book.<br /><br />I just do NOT get all the rave reviews about this one. I mean, it wasn't BAD, but it certainly wasn't great. Nothing happens! We go through the tedious description of what it takes to clean up an old livery and turn it into a coffee shop not once but TWICE!<br /><br />And tagging this as LGBTQ is extremely misleading and just wrong. The two lead characters kiss twice. There's no real romance here. There are no feelings. We're led to believe there's a slight attraction between Viv and Tandri, but I never actually felt any of it.<br /><br />The characters are all nice enough, if not flat, but where the author really failed the readers was the world-building...or complete lack thereof. This book could have taken place in Seattle or Chicago, and I never would have known the difference. Aside from the characters being different species, we learn next to nothing about Thune.<br /><br />Overall, while I didn't hate it, I certainly didn't love it, and I feel quite deceived by all the glowing reviews of this book. Either there are a LOT of vapid people out there who need very little to entertain/stimulate them, or there are a lot of people jumping on the BookTok fav bandwagon, because this book is nothing special.

      "review": "I liked this for the first, like, three chapters but it got stale, repetitive, and dull super quickly. I’ve read a lot of slice-of-life fiction (mostly Japanese translations) but this was lacking in the key tenets of what makes cozy, slice-of-life fiction good: rich dialogue, strong sense of place, interesting characters, tight writing. Ultimately, this isn’t cozy, it’s just a book about nothing: the characters are flat, there’s no plot, there’s no conflict. Nothing drives this story. <br /><br />It’s got one of the most cardboard, vanilla, one-dimensional cast of characters in fiction. They’re so saccharine, simpering, and boring. Viv is a passenger for literally all her good fortune: everything just falls in her lap and she doesn’t need to do anything, learn anything, or grow in any way. She’s super whiny and I don’t really see any of her alleged fierceness. Tandri wasn’t much better and had an aloofness that kept the reader at arm’s length. Cal and Thimble were one dimensional and largely mute. There was so much potential for diverse, rich characters that just wasn’t realized. <br /><br />There’s no sense of time or place in this. The setting is woefully underdeveloped and underutilized. The supporting cast was as well. There was so much missed opportunity in dealing with the varying size, diverse needs, and communication barriers of fantasy creatures trying to navigate a coffee shop. Instead, we get a generic cafe where everyone speaks English and has normal hands and mouths. Ugh. There’s some insinuation that this is Middle Ages-ish but because of the “gnomeish technology”, it felt awkwardly present. As a modern reader, this diluted any sense of time, place, or atmosphere and felt lazy. <br /><br />The writing is pretty poor. There’s no heart, no plot, no rich characters, no anything. It is so superficial and reads like a grindy NPC side quest: open your cafe, upgrade your equipment, install a fan - it was like reading a list of home renovation to-dos writing by the world’s most unimaginative builder. It felt like the author was targeting a word count rather than using words to tell a story. The writing was so bland and perfunctory - it reminded me of my high school writing assignments where everything was linear, there was no depth, and it was bulked out with bullshit to reach a word count. It was surprisingly amateur. Come to think of it, this book might work better if you scoop out the swearing and gear it toward middle graders? Idk. <br /><br />The romance was totally unnecessary: the whole thing felt forced, embarrassing, and uncomfortable as a result of both cardboard, uninteresting characters and a zero emotional connection to either character nor an clear understanding of their purported connection to each other. <br /><br />Also! How many goddamn times did the menu need to be repeated?! Filler and word count, pals, I tell ya. <br /><br />I mean, there was a (largely irrelevant) addendum called “Pages to Fill” FFS. <br /><br />The one thing that made this enjoyable was my husband reading it aloud and doing voices for the characters. I think if I’d read it on my own, I would have lost patience with it. His delivery made it tolerable. I like the dire cat but I didn’t love his ending. <br /><br />Bottom line: Commercial cozy fiction isn’t for me. I still need interesting characters, some semblance of plot, and good writing."

      "review": "Legends &amp; Lattes is a fun, cozy fantasy! I listened to this one on audio, but would love to read it in print as well. I also hope to read more about these characters in future installments. Our main character is Viv - a huge \"Orc\" who seems to have been a mercenary warrior with a sword she named \"Black Blood\". Viv is tired of her life, and has dreams of settling down and opening - a coffee shop. She saves her gold and coins, and after acquiring a special magic stone in a battle, she sets out to start a new life and settles in a town called Thune. There Viv begins to make friends, and turns an old dilapidated horse stable into a thriving business. I loved Cal, the gnome who helps her build her shop, then Tandri arrives - she is a magical creature that has artistic flair and mans the coffee machines with Viv. Some of their customers bring their own talents to the business - Thimble with his baking, and Pendry with music. The last addition is an enormous cat Viv and Tandri name Amity. I picture an enormous Norwegian forest cat in my mind! Viv's success brings some unsavory characters to the shop -who are demanding \"protection\" payments. A former colleague has also come searching for the magic stone - and will stop at nothing to get it. <br />The main lesson in the book is - you can write your own story. You don't have to stay in one role your whole life, and that often people (and magical creatures) should not be judged by their physical attributes or stereotypes. This is such a feel good story! If you liked the movie Shrek, or read \"The House on the Cerulean Sea\" I feel you would love this book! There is a same sex romance, but it is not explicit and again, reminds me of the books written by T. J. Klune. Amazingly, this book was the result of National Novel Writing Month - NaNoWriMo. The author narrates the audiobook and does a great job!"

      "review": "If I was rating only on my enjoyment of the book, this would be five stars. Given that I haven't read much in the last few years, this was a good introduction back into novels. It was very easy to read, and very comforting.<br /><br />Positives:<br />1. As already mentioned, a quick, easy read.<br />2. The cast of characters was very charming, and I enjoyed their interactions as we saw their dynamics change and develop across the chapters. Viv is an interesting MC and I personally love her direct nature and the caring role she assumes toward others. <br />3. The actual coffee-shop owner aspect was well managed, seeming fairly realistic and covering both practical aspects as well as customer-related conflicts. It was interesting to see the characters work together to resolve this.<br />4. I also really liked Baldree's writing style - a lot of books catering to YA and fantasy reads, to me, often go too heavy on their description and world-building expositions. But this one has an excellent balance, always relying on show over tell. It was easy to imagine the environment from Baldree's descriptions.<br />5. The romance is really organic and sweet. It didn't feel forced to fulfil some kind of appeal in the story, it just felt right for the two characters at that point in their lives. I liked that it was subtle and slow to grow, but also didn't feel like it was sprung on the reader out of nowhere.<br /><br />Negatives:<br />1. For being set in a fantasy setting, the author really doesn't take advantage of that at all. We learn almost nothing about the way magic works, or the relations between species, or anything past shallow 'orcs aren't well liked' type stuff. I would have loved to know more about the actual world this takes place in, rather than just applying general fantasy archetypes.<br />2. My second issue kind of leads on from the first. It feels like the time-period of the setting was super unclear. We learn about 3/4 of the way in that its the late 1300s, but the setting doesn't reflect that as much as it should. I thought that having a coffee machine be a 'gnomish contraption' was cool at first, but as the story progresses every issue is resolved by the addition of some new machine that is laughably modern, and then explained away as being made by gnomes or unspecified magic. When the bard of the story shows up with what is essentially an electric lute and amplifier, I had to giggle a little.<br />3. The character writing could have been just a littttle bit better. The side characters don't really change throughout the book; though they warm up to the main character, they don't personally have much of an arc. Tandri could be the exception, but I still finished the book just wishing to know MORE about her. Viv was also confusing in some ways. For someone with years of adventuring experience bloodying her hands, we really don't see much evidence of that life. I feel like it should have been harder for her to stop sleeping by a sword, or she should have at least expected logically that her shop would be attacked with arson.<br />4. The plot resolves so... suddenly? The conflict with the madrigal and with fennus is over before it can really get good, and not due to any action on Viv's part. It all feels like pure luck, which makes the victory a little less sweet.<br /><br />Overall, I loved this book from beginning to end, but I felt it could have been so much more with a few changes. As someone that loves fantasy, it is simply my preference to see more of the world and learn more about the characters I loved. Nonetheless, Legends &amp; Lattes delivered the cosy, low-stakes fantasy that I wanted."

It was just very <i> satisfying </i> to watch Viv grow her business from the ground up. You just got the sense you were rooting for this loveable underdog taking a risk and branching out from what was expected of her. Viv is really endearing because she's kind, competent, and just a little bit out of her depth. You can't help but smile every time she has a small victory. <br /><br />And the side characters are so loveable too! Thimble is maybe my favorite, because come on, who doesn't love a tiny baker?? But Cal and Tandri are also really solid characters that are great foils for Viv. I love how through trial and error, the team just figures out together how to make this coffee business work. <input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"spoiler__control\" aria-label=\"The following text has been marked spoiler.

I guess I just love cafes??? </label><br /><br />The slice of life parts I quite enjoyed.

Maybe I glossed over the explanation, but it frankly didn't make sense to me. It seemed like such a big issue that got resolved too easily. The Fennus stealing the stone part made more sense to me. And I liked that his ending is just \"karma\" because the stone brings like-minded people together. I'm not sure that I fully bought the idea that the shop burned down but the community paid for all the repairs. That too seems like too much of a silver bullet. But I won't complain too much about that storyline, it was nice to end on a high note. The final issue I had though, was I thought the romance between Viv and Tandri felt a little forced to me. I read their relationship as being more platonic. And I wish the author had put in more scenes of banter or sexual tension to warrant the romantic reveal. </label><br /><br />All that being said, I did really enjoy this book and would recommend it.

I read Legends &amp; Lattes last year as an ebook and have wanted a paperback since. I finally got it this year and was waiting for a good time to reread it. This felt like a good time because I also wanted a comfort read.<br /><br />Legends &amp; Lattes is a cosy low-stakes fantasy about an orc who gives up her way of life to open a coffee shop. In the process of setting up the shop and running it, she meets people who become her cadre or found family. It's super cute and comforting. I love every single character. And I love the love the book has for coffee and coffee shops.<br /><br />Since I had the paperback this time, I went all in to annotate. I don't think I annotated as much as I could but I did mark quite a bit. I'm looking forward to rereading the book multiple times and adding annotations over the years. While annotating is fun all the time, it is even more so on rereads. I love adding marks to previously marked lines, filling up pages slowly, and conversing with my old self.<br /><br />I mainly read Legends &amp; Lattes in the mornings with a cup of coffee—reading and annotating slowly. It was great &lt;3 I'm looking forward to the next book by the author which is set in the same world."

      "review": "I loved this book! It hit all the right spots for me. As an aside I highly recommend the audiobook which is also read by the author. <br /><br />This book is categorized as a cozy fantasy, or a \"novel of high fantasy and low stakes\" and while I think this is sort of correct, low stakes makes it sound less exciting than it is. There is conflict, and when it happens the stakes are very high to the characters. <br /><br />The major theme of this book is making a new start. Viv decides that she is tired of her current profession and wants to strike out to fulfil her passion (opening a coffee shop). The themes of the book (pursuing your passion, even if it means changing your career; finding the right people, building trust and forging lasting relationships, not making assumptions based on appearance, not falling back on old (possibly bad) habits, and many more) are well written and highly relevant to a large number of people, which is likely why this book is so popular. <br /><br />The romance is light and so incredibly cute and sweet and I loved it. The experience of reading this book really felt like curling up with a sweet, warm drink (I don't drink coffee, but we'll go with hot chocolate). <br /><br />The one complaint I had (and it's tiny and probably wouldn't have happened with the print book) is that I got confused because a couple of characters had similar enough sounding names that I sometimes didn't know who we were talking about until we got far enough into the situation that I could go, oh the bard (or whoever it was). But it was a small enough complaint that it didn't impact my reading experience that much. <br /><br />Anyway, highly recommend!"

      "review": "The actual story is only about 265 pages. The rest consists of an interview, acknowledgements and a short story/prologue called \"Pages to Fill\".<br /><br />I enjoyed the first 80 pages or so. But as soon as the protagonist had established her little coffee shop I quickly lost interest. For me there's a difference between low stakes and no suspense whatsoever. Every problem is quite easily solved within two or three short chapters.<br /><br />What kept me going was that I expected the novel to turn into more of a romance because every one kept talking about the sapphic love story. But that aspect is almost non existent, sadly.<br /><br />The last two thirds were extremely boring and I was just hoping for the book to end. I only skimmed the last 40 pages or so because I wasn't interested at all anymore.<br /><br />I read another review where they pointed out that if you didn't know what coffee and pastries were you wouldn't know after reading this book. And I agree with this person wholeheartedly. The tastes aren't really described. You're only getting vague implementations about the heavenly scent and tastes but aromas aren't depicted at all. And for a story that centers around the founding of a coffee shop that's just really sad.<br /><br />I also think that the fantasy world in this book heavily relies on the reader's knowledge of other fantastic settings. The creatures aren't really described either. If you don't know what an orc or a goblin is in the first place, you won't after just reading this book.<br /><br />In summary I felt like the author was able to convey some kind of coziness but I didn't get anything else from this book."

      "review": "This book isn't your usual fantasy, and I mean that in the best way possible. It's the coziest, most wholesome, comfiest fantasy that I've ever read and will give you all the warm fuzzies. I got so comfortable every time I sat down to read that I fell asleep after only a few pages, making this challenging to finish. But I blame that on my mid-30's and the perpetual need for a nap.<br /><br />The brief prologue gives just enough backstory to set the stage for the story, which captures your heart very quickly. A tale of unlikely friendships, hard work paying off into glorious success, and the cutest slow burn sapphic romance, this novel delivered more than I was expecting. I was so pleased that I made this my first read of 2024.<br /><br />Reading the warm descriptions of coffee and pastries from characters who were being introduced to them for the first time was so heart warming and without a doubt were responsible for my own cups of coffee while reading. (I highly recommend coffee with this book, your own senses really bring the story into reality.)<br /><br />Not only was the story cozy and warm, but it was edited very well, too. I don't think I even clocked any errors. If there even were any errors, I was so swept up in the detail and comfort of the story that I didn't notice them. There were even some words I had to look up and was glad to learn something new. The fantasy characters were a joy to read about, my favorite was little Thimble. He was so sweet and animated for a little guy who communicated mostly without words. The chapters were delightfully short, making the book go by faster. Nothing was drawn out and agonizingly slow over too many pages like some fantasy books.<br /><br />Overall, this was a wonderfully wholesome book. Even the climax and ending were dripping with themes of togetherness and perseverance, however shocking and dreadful the events that transpired were. Legends &amp; Lattes will most definitely be my new comfort read anytime I'm sick, need a pick-me-up, or simply want to read something warm and familiar. I can see myself reading this over and over again and never tiring of it. It also has the potential to inspire my own creativity and get some things done I've put on the back burner.<br /><br />I couldn't be happier with this book. Hats off to the author, it was phenomenal and truly deserving of five stars.<br /><br />P.S. The short story at the end was a lovely addition and gave a peek into Liv's life pre-coffee shop as she pieced together her dream for the future that would become Legends &amp; Lattes. I can't wait to read Bookshops &amp; Bonedust."

      "review": "I thoroughly enjoyed this short novel. The premise is unique and engaging and the characters are (at a surface level) interesting. That being said, I can definitely see why people don’t like this book. It needs a serious developmental editor and considering how the author wrote it for NaNoWriMo and self-published it three months later, that makes sense. My main complaint is that the world and characters are not explored enough. I still think I will be returning to this book as a quick, easy read to unwind.<br /><br />I really, really wish the characters were more fleshed out. All the characters are pretty basic. Tandri even tells us more about Viv than we learn by reading about her- that dreaded telling not showing plothole. Which is weird, because Tandri has only known Viv for a few weeks. Viv- and all the characters- are super unique and have a lot of potential, they just need more development. I would even describe all the characters as NPCs- coming from someone who knows next to nothing about gaming.<br /><br />This is very much a plot? what plot? kind of novel. I completely understand why some people dislike this book. There isn’t much plot and all of the conflicts are minor and resolved fairly quickly. This is definitely a downfall in most books, but I ended up enjoying it anyway because it was surface-level and low-intensity. It’s a low-stakes “romance”.<br /><br />This brings me to the quote-unquote romance. This is often touted as a sapphic romance. I hesitate to call it a romance. The romance is not fleshed out or developed. The two characters have no space to learn about each other and fall in love. If it weren’t for a rushed-into, poorly-written kiss, you would never have known these two were interested in each other. Honestly, if the author had decided to go with an asexual partnership, it would have felt a lot more natural. Tandri and Viv definitely feel like they have a queerplatonic relationship. It would have been really cool if the author had gone that route.<br /><br />There are definitely gaps in this story, but I can’t find it in myself to hate it. Reading this felt like I was sitting in a coffee shop with friends. It gives you that homely, comfortable feel. I would just caution potential readers not to expect much depth from the story or characters."

I appreciated the female Orc representation and sweet slow-burn sapphic romance but this book wasn't anything special for me.<br /><br /><br />(2024 - 4/50 \"a book by a self-published author\")"

As someone who is dreaming/planning to open a bookshop, this cosy fantasy tale of an orc turning her back on force &amp; violence, finding a quiet new life and starting up her own coffee shop... well, it got me right in the feels.<br /><br />Bits I liked:<br />- the warmth and diversity of the characters is beautiful, each one clear and so lovable<br />- the strange juxtaposition of high fantasy characters and themes in this soft, slow world was wonderful<br />- evocative food and drink descriptions, with cute ways in which the characters invent items that most readers will be familiar with<br />- the sapphic romance matches the pace of the story, and is gentle &amp; believable<br />- the writing style is great, and this author is definitely an auto-buy for me now!<br />- interesting post-story elements (no spoilers here!)<br />- the highs and lows of dedicating your time to a passion, all the thought Viv puts in and the processes they go through, it all just made me want to open my bookshop even more!<br /><br />Bits I liked less:<br />- it's quite short so even though the pace is gentle, quite a lot happens in a short space of time, so sometimes it feels like things happen or are resolved very quickly (or maybe I just really wanted more time in that world!)<br /><br />I'm really excited to hear that a second book is on the way, set in the same world but with new main characters (and some familiar faces apparently), and this time centered on a bookshop, I believe!"

A gorgeous, well developed slow burn lesbian romance that is sweet and meaningful. Awkward butch x tough femme. Slice of life high fantasy. DND inspired. Beautiful descriptions of food and coffee. What else could you want from a high fantasy novel?<br /><br />Legends and Lattes caught my eye the second I heard about it. My expectations were high, and it completely exceeded them! I need more high fantasy books like this. There was no stress, no anxiety for the characters while reading, but somehow the plot was still incredibly engaging and I couldn’t put it down. <br /><br />Both Tandri and Viv want to be seen as more than the stereotypes of their races, succubi who seduce and orcs who kill. And in doing so, find this kind of acceptance in eachother. That’s definitely a theme here, characters wishing to be seen as more than what they are. Cal the hob, is wary of Viv at first, until she shows him unconditional friendship, that she doesn’t care that he’s a hob, that humans shun him, because humans don’t like her either. She does the same with Thimble. <br /><br />At first I was kinda worried, since the author is a man. I was worried that Viv’s and Tandri’s relationship would be super sexed up for the male gaze, but that’s not what happened at all! Their relationship is based on trust and a firm friendship and truly caring about one another, until it blossoms into something more at the end of the book. <br /><br />Overall I absolutely loved this book, and I really hope we get more books in the future about Tandri, Viv and the rest of the crew!"

It’s a super cozy fantasy (yes, cozy), with minimal traipsing through hell and back like in generic fantasy. I never knew there could be a thing such as cozy fantasy, and yet here we are. The amount of baked goods and explanations of them will make you hungry, maybe even drool. The coffee beans seem almost magical even if they’re not actually magical. It brings the characters together.<br /><br />I love the queer representation in this one, even if it’s subtle. As someone who is asexual, I truly appreciate the minimal sexual content. Totally shipping two characters and I hope you do too!<br /><br />I hadn’t even finished the first book before I decided to pick up the second book.

      "review": "Legends &amp; Lattes is a cute, cozy fantasy that deserves the hype it's received. Reminiscent of Becky Chambers's work crossed with the coffee shop in Before the Coffee Gets Cold, it's low-stakes, which is not to say unemotional or unmotivated, but merely that it's a fantasy where the empire or the fate of humanity isn't at stake. Instead, it's about Viv's quest to put her violent, quest-completing days behind her and open a coffee shop where she can create something knew.<br /><br />Some of the \"discoveries\" could feel a bit corny at times, but I forgave that, because the characters were compelling enough that I didn't care. There's Liv of course, and succubus Tandri, and gnome Cal, but I admit all my love was for rattkin baker Thimble and the direcat who adopts the coffeeshop for her own. This book was sweet, fun, and made me really crave cinnamon rolls. It all felt very tangible and was a great novel for found family and soft queer romance.<br /><br />Content warnings for sexual harassment, violence."

      "review": "This is a fast, quick read, but it does tend to get slow and repetitive at times. The pages aren’t too long though so it still is easy to get through it. I would have finished this a lot sooner but I had a busy weekend and didn’t read (hence why it took so long this time). It’s an alright book though.<br /><br />I don’t usually read fantasy or cozy fantasy or whatever people want to classify this book under. So I may not be like the expert on what makes it good or not. I just know that it had some interesting elements, but it was the same stuff over and over with no real climax. Like it felt like you’re just reading the same chapters over and over again with different words but the same point. Which sucks, cause it could have been wrote so much better, like so much more could have been done. I felt like this book just teases you, like it sets it up to be this cool adventure and it’s kind of just a let down of repetitiveness. <br /><br />I heard so many good things about this book, especially the whole queer romance in it. And I’m not really getting the hype around that. Because yes, throughout there’s light mention that Viv is crushing on Tandri but nothing happens. And then finally at darn near the end they have a kiss. Like all this half followed through tension with nothing to show. I don’t really like when authors hype up that they have queer characters and then like 1% of the story mentions it at all. It’s hardly in there.<br /><br />I don’t know how I felt about this book. It isn’t terrible, but it isn’t the greatest thing I’ve read. Maybe all cozy fantasy’s are wrote like this, I’m not sure. It’s a little boring at times, but it does have enough stuff that keeps it interesting. <br /><br />I’d give it a try if you had even any interest at all. I wouldn’t listen to any reviews though. Because in my own opinion, it’s not as bad as everyone says but it also isn’t as good as people make it out to be. Read at your own risk, decide what it does for you. "

Opening up a coffee shop. After the first chapter, the book draws you in one chapter at a time. The characters are well thought out and I must say so likable!! I loved Viv's coffee shop and all the coziness and good energy created in it. This book is about appreciating the small things in life. To take a step back and smile and what you have in your life. <br />The only thing I did not like and please do not hate me...but I did not think it necessary to have a love relationship in this book. it strongly represents friendships and those who will have your back. I thought the queer relationship came out of no where and did not need to be there. And it is not because it was queer, it could have been any type of romantic relationship. But I commend this author not to make it the main focus, it was so subtle and sweet...just felt the book did not need it."

      "review": "Viv is ready to hang up her sword, and start a new life. After falling in love with coffee in a gnomish city, she researches and decides to open her own, and the first ever, coffee shop in the city of Thune. She faces many challenges along the way, one of the big ones being that no one in Thune has ever heard of coffee, and another being the Madrigals, the crime bosses in the city. As Viv works to build out a place for herself, she also carves out space for new friends. <br /><br />This book was such a cozy read. I love coffee so a lot of the jokes made me laugh. There isn’t much to the plot of the story but it flows well. I loved how Viv was trying to hang up her old life and jumped head first into something new. The side characters were awesome, and a book mostly about hanging out in a coffee shop was a vibe for me. <br /><br />Check out Legends &amp; Lattes if you like found family, queer representation, cozy vibes, and coffee!"

      "review": "This book is the definition of cozy fantasy! If you're looking for found family and just hanging around with some lovely characters in their every day life - this is the book to go to! I really loved it even though there wasn't that much plot in it (though I have to say that I expect as much. If you go into the book expecting a normal fantasy book - you will be disappointed!). Like I said already, the characters were very lovely and sweet, their relationships are communicated well (not only through words but through non-verbal communication as well, if not more so). What I also appreciated was the queer romance that came very natural to the story and didn't involve a coming-out story (not that there's something wrong with that, I just wanted to read some cute wlw - which it definitely delivered)<br />I really recommend reading it! :)"

      "review": "A soothing serenade of a story that is soft and sweet; I highly recommend reading this for a gentle introduction into fantasy fiction, but also as a general tantalising tale of self-discovery touching on the importance of pursuing happiness. <br /><br />Twisting the classic tale of a tired, troubled soul hoping to build a new life and adding high fantasy features made this book appeal to me, because I simply prefer to read about kooky characters and creatures than human beings. Also the touch of mystery and queer romance will never go unappreciated by me! Thanks to my librarian friends for the recommendation. <br /><br />Overall, I am delighted with this book, the characters were well-rounded having great individual personalities and purposes within the story, the pacing kept me enticed, the strong female characters had me enamoured (in love with Tandri), and although the ending and character progression was predictable, I honestly did not care because it was meant to be cosy not catastrophic.

      "review": "I gotta say I absolutely LOVED this. It was so casual, it was so cute, so adorable and yet also really exciting at times. <br /><br />I fell in love with those characters and I was so so sad to say goodbye to them in the end of the book<br />. <br />Ask yourself this question. How do you explain coffee to someone who's never even heard of it? If you are intrigued by that question then you have to read this book filled with cinnamon rolls, lattes and iced coffees in a city filled with intriguing and amazing...let's say people, who have never heard of what any of those are. <br /><br />I love the LGBTQ+ representation in this book because it's not the main character trait of the characters, it's casual, it's just a normal relationship as it should be while also just being utterly adorable. I love and appreciate when a book is about all the issues that come with being part of the community and goes head on about the relationship being queer but sometimes it's nice to see it just be without needing to say it's *queer*. <br /><br />This book made me feel warm and happy. Recommend!!"

      "review": "I'll start by saying the premise of the book is really appealing. It's creative to have a DnD-based book around a coffee shop, and it's clear that the author set out to write a simple, feel-good story. <br /><br />But in the way that a Hallmark movie is /only/ a \"simple, feel-good story\". . . that's what this book is. There is a plot, and there are characters, but it was very, very simple. Which is unfortunate because there is a lot of potential in the concept. There are so many scenes in this book that, if fully fleshed-out, could make this book leaps and bounds better but the author never took time to fully savor the moments; the author never lingered or took time the delve deep into a scene. It's almost as if the author was just rushing to get to the end of the book to say that it was done. <br /><br />Not to mention this book is written in third person. Which isn't always a bad thing, but the narrator definitely isn't doing us any favors with the way he completely fails to explain what is going through the MC's head. We are almost never privy to the main character's thoughts, feelings, or emotions, let alone any substantive reflection on her past challenges or current hopes and fears. <br /><br />And its this shortcoming with the narration that makes the romance and the romantic build-up basically non-existent. This book has no business marketing itself as a romance or as LGBTQ+. The narrator provides almost no inclination that the MC is starting to like the character who will be the romantic interest, LET ALONE develop romantic feelings for that character. You know the method of historic straight-washing wit the \"and they were roommates\" narrative? It's almost as if that's what the author was /aiming for/, except in this book it's \"and they were co-workers.\" There is maybe ONE scene that could be construed as semi-romantic and not only is there almost no substance, but the narrator (not surprisingly) fails to tell us what is going through MC's head during this scene. SO MANY TIMES the narrator mentions that MC \"hesitates and considers responding,\" or that MC \"was about to say something, but said something else,\" WITHOUT TELLING THE READER WHAT THE MC WAS ABOUT TO SAY. Was she was about to confess her love? Was she about to tell a secret? What made her decide against saying something? How does she feel in making this decision of what to say? WE DON'T KNOW. Also, if I had a dollar for every time the narrator referred to the NAMED, prominent female character and (alleged) love interest as \"the woman,\" I would have at least $5. \"The woman walked away.\" \"The woman stood before her.\" WHAT DOES THIS ACCOMPLISH OTHER THAN DEHUMANIZING AND OBJECTIFYING THE PERSON WHO IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE LOVE INTEREST AND SECOND MAIN CHARACTER? I understand doing this once, MAYBE twice as a stylistic choice to emphasize that she is a woman and highlight romantic tension in a scene (but this might be giving the author too much credit because there is SO LITTLE development to these romantic scenes), but this character has a name and has had a name for many, many chapters! <br /><br />I am absolutely baffled that this book has 4.24 stars. The only thing saving this book from one star is that the side characters, albeit underdeveloped, are sweet and endearing. "

      "review": "Did I enjoy this? Yes, very much, actually.<br /><br /><br />But will I read the next one? Probably not.<br /><br /><br />\"Legends&amp;Lattes\" is an awesome success story (it started as a self published novel and it became an Internet sensation) and a cozy little book, perfect for a small break between your usual epic fantasy novels. <br /><br /><br />As advertised, its stakes are low - there is no plot, per se, but a \"slice of life\" account of how a retired orc warrior opened her own coffee shop and the friends she made along the way. There are some obstacles, of course, so do expect a little conflict, and there's a budding F/F romance in there, too (to be honest, probably the best built F/F romance I've read so far), which works well as a subplot and which doesn't take over the story. The narration is charmingly simple (no flowery phrases here, for which I am terribly grateful, because I am almost never a fan of the flowery narration variation) and the novel is, overall, an easy read (one could probably read it in one sitting, actually).<br /><br /><br />Some might say that the characters are a little bland and maybe a bit generic (mostly the secondary ones), but, despite this, I personally found them adorable, Viv in particular. Moreover, Tandri did manage to annoy me somewhat - and characters eliciting emotion are the best characters, after all (even if that emotion is annoyance). <br /><br /><br />So I really enjoyed it, especially since I've seen the book everywhere and I was curious to know what the fuss was all about. And it delivered, being light, lovely, and lovable (are lovely and lovable synonyms?). <br /><br /><br />However, I don't feel like a second book in the same vein would do much for me. Its novelty factor was the \"slice of life\" idea, and now that I've seen it done, I don't know if I want to come back for another one. Charming as it was, \"Legends&amp;Lattes\" didn't have the wow factor - that \"something else\" - to hook me in for a sequel [I will expand on this in the next paragraph]. The characters, albeit huggable, are forgettable, blending easily in with other representations of their stereotypes. And the lack of plot would become a problem, I just know it, because - and I can't stress this enough - nothing really happens.<br /><br /><br />Back to that \"wow\" factor: probably similarly to everyone else, I like books, and then I *really like* (aka \"love almost to the point of obsession\") books. For one book to get into that second category, it needs to have *something*. For me, \"Legends&amp;Lattes\" did not.<br /><br /><br />So, to conclude, who is \"Legends&amp;Lattes\" for? You will probably enjoy this if:<br /><br /><br />- you are looking for an \"anti-grimdark\", feel-good fantasy book<br /><br />- you need something cozy to help you relax <br /><br />- you want an easy, non-effortless read<br /><br />- you are looking for a cute F/F romance subplot <br /><br />- you're a fan of the \"hero/ heroine wants to start over and opens their own business\" contemporary stories and want to give light fantasy a try<br /><br />- among your favourite tropes, you include \"found family\" &amp; \"old life behind\"<br /><br />- you enjoyed \"House in the Cerulean Sea\" a lot and want something with similar vibes (DISCLAIMER: I don't like comparing books, and I also believe \"House...\" is MUCH better than \"Legends..\", but it's the only other cozy fantasy with low(er) stakes I could think of and they both give me the same 'feel good vibe with nothing happening in terms of epic action')<br /><br /><br />Who is \"Legends&amp;Lattes\" not for? You will probably dislike/ grow bored with this if:<br /><br /><br />- you are craving a dynamic, action packed book<br /><br />- you need an intricate plot in your novels (or an actual plot, to be honest)<br /><br />- you want character development and/ or high worldbuilding <br /><br />- you believe that reading about the inner workings of how to open a business is as boring as watching paint dry<br /><br />- you don't have a lot of patience for villains who make no sense or characters who hide things from their friends <br /><br />- you really don't see yourself reading about how an orc opened a coffee shop "

I simply had to see what’s it all about and one more book to add is never a bad thing. Did I enjoy it? Sure. It made for a perfect light, fun beach read. Hell, coffee- or teashop based books are something I generally wish there was more of. But I did have some issues with the worldbuilding and immersion as well.<br /><br />The premise is simple: Viv, an orc, is tired of adventuring life and after one last quest for a luck-bringing artifact, retires to open a coffee shop in the city of Thune. With the help of her new friends, her business soon starts to thrive.<br /><br />Despite my love of slice of life, I hesitated a little with this one. It was self-pub, with which I do not have a great track record (yes, it has been picked up by Tor since, but my ebook is the original version), the author is a narrator for mostly litRPG and progression books (genres I detest), and it’s inspired by D&amp;D, which I have approximately zero interest in. Mostly due to the clichés. In the end, neither really mattered – it was a smooth, easy read I could not put down. Nothing groundbreaking or unique or mindblowing, but as comfortable as it gets.<br /><br />However, smooth and easy does not mean without hiccups. I was pretty annoyed by how the author seemed intent on putting in modern world inventions – AC, an electric guitar(?), an espresso machine, cinnamon rolls, chocolate croissants – with serial numbers filed off into the book one after the other. And as the title signals, being intent on calling coffee with milk a latte. Is it a D&amp;D influence? I can’t say. Handwaving them as gnomish or no, the sheer amount of it broke my immersion and really wasn’t my cup of…coffee. One or two things I could have taken, and at <i>least</i> it was not as heinously offensive as straight-up putting jeans and diners in your fantasy book without renaming or signalling that it’s modern world (something I’ve actually seen and DNF’d a book for, by the way), but this felt lazy and not especially well-integrated. I can easily see how it could be a dealbreaker for more pedantic readers.<br /><br />This makes it sound like I didn’t enjoy it, and I <i>did</i> but there’s only so many words for “it was fine.” If you want a book where you can turn your brain off and just chill, I highly recommend it. If you’re a serial worldbuilding overthinker, though, well. Maybe stay clear.<br /><br /><b>Enjoyment:</b> 4/5<br /><b>Execution:</b> 3/5<br /><br /><b>Recommended to:</b> fellow fans of slice of life SFF, those who like coffee shop AUs or are looking for something fluffy and cozy, if you want a casual f/f romance subplot<br /><b>Not recommended to:</b> pedants, those who don’t like strong D&amp;D influences<br /><br /><i>More reviews on my blog, <a href=\"https://otherworldsreviews.wordpress.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">To Other Worlds</a>.</i>"

      "review": "I haven't read a cozy fantasy before and given that this book is its posterchild, I thought it would be the perfect place to start. I was in the middle of a pretty intense series and needed a quick, fun read to relax with, so it was time to pick this up.<br /><br />Since I had no experience with the genre, I had no clue what to expect going in. I was pleasantly surprised with the first couple of chapters. Viv and Cal were so thoughtful and mature, which made them really lovable. I didn't mind the characters being in a low stakes setting. I often wished for characters at the end of more intense series to have a couple chapters of just being happy. This felt like it filled up that longing.<br /><br />Initially, I compared it to Bee and Puppycat, Senshi from Delicious in Dungeon, and side characters in Studio Ghibli movies. It had casual reminders of how you should treat yourself and others well and nice vibes in general, which I liked.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this did not last. Around halfway through the book, I just wasn't feeling it anymore and felt like the characters just weren't the same ones I liked at the start.<br /><br />The more the coffee shop developed, the less cozy it felt. It started to give me a millennial vibe, like how Starbucks was all the rage with hipsters when it just opened. It also just kinda took me back to when I worked in food service, which was not cozy at all. The fantasy aspect was severely underutilized. If we just switched all their races to human (which isn't hard to imagine) and changed the stone to a four leaf clover, there wouldn't be any fantasy involved. It was just too anachronistic and really pulled me out of the fantasy. I don't recommend this to fantasy lovers, I think contemporary readers or people who just really love coffee shops would get more enjoyment out of it.<br /><br />As for how I felt about the characters, primarily Viv, there are spoilers in this paragraph. In the beginning, I really liked how she was using the skills from her past life to help her make her coffee shop, like when she scoped out Cal. It felt like she was acknowledging her past and making the best of it. So it was very unfortunate when she was completely unwilling to use those skills in the future. The whole Madrigal plotline wasn't well handled in my opinion. So all the other businesses still get extorted and Viv is chill with it? Makes her a lot less loveable in my eyes. I was expecting her to kind of become the protector of the town, but I guess she was too busy being ashamed of her past to look out for others. And it was really stupid of her not to safeguard against a fire since that threat was mentioned right from the start.<br /><br />Almost everything in that coffee shop was described as \"gnomish\" so I couldn't help but think that Viv is just culturally appropriating gnomish food and architecture. It's probably not that deep, but it was a little weird, especially since we barely ever saw the one gnome in the cast.<br /><br />Lastly, one of the things that touched me was Viv telling Calamity/Cal \"I don't need your name to suit me.\" It was a very cute and needed message about being more accepting and not needing to fit to other people's standards. So I found it incredibly hypocritical when Hemington asked not to be called Hem and Viv just brushed him off and ignored him.<br /><br />The pacing of this story was fine, nice easily digestible chunks with a clear focus for every chapter. However, once I started finding Viv unlikeable, there wasn't anything to keep me hooked. It wasn't really funny, the romance was just alright, and the plot in general got a little stale. The found family aspect should've been leaned into way harder. In the end, I felt like they were more like coworkers that got along than family. The story could have used more depth and interactions between all of the characters, not just Viv.<br /><br />I won't be continuing this series, but I am willing to give cozy fantasy another try in hopes that this one was just an unfortunate dud."

      "review": "I loved how cozy this book was, the plot was interesting at times but what I enjoyed most was just to follow along with Viv as she builds her cafe from the ground up. It would have been nice for her to continue building relationships in her community but I think the plot started moving along too quickly after the whole mysterious-past-catching-up trope.<br /><br />The reason why I'm rating it at 2 stars is because the whole relationship with Tandri was so unnecessary. I feel like it was only there for the sake of inclusivity and adding literally nothing to the book. I think they should have stayed as best friends and moved in as roommates, not everything has to be romantic and turn into a relationship! There were two quick scenes of romance and it came out of left-field. They spend so much time making sure that we understand that Tandri doesn't want to identify with the nature of what she is and then immediately starts a relationship with the main character. It opposes her intentions from the start and honestly, the way that it was written gave me the ick. <br /><br />Aside from that, I did love how their friendship was supportive and even unique because of how different Viv and Tandri are. I loved Cal and Thimble and even the enemies-to-friends arch with the Madrigal. However, I think the book also lacked in giving us a good basis for Viv's old friends that come back and the whole plot with Fennus was too random almost like the author was grasping for anything interesting to shove into the plot.<br /><br />For a slow-paced and calm book, there were way too many parts that were unnecessarily sped up and that kept me from thoroughly enjoying it.<br />"

It wrapped me in a warm, coffee scented hug that lingered well after the final page. <br /><br />This is a story about new beginnings, and wow did I relate to Viv’s journey of starting over. Viv was such a compelling main character, full of all the complexities and contradictions that I love. I found her combination of slight awkwardness and toughness adorable and relatable. She’s just a girl who loves coffee and books and her friends, and if that’s not a gal after my own heart, I don’t know what is. <br /><br />Tandri was an absolute gem, and the romance between her and Viv was absolutely ADORABLE. I love how you see Tandri’s layers slowly pull back throughout the book until her true self was revealed, and the joy of true acceptance that she got to experience. I also totally fell in love with Thimble and Cel and even the local organized crime of this adorable small town. <br /><br />There is some cozy magic woven into the pages of this book. You feel the cold air and smell the hint of coffee and cinnamon on the breeze. This book literally made me go out and buy supplies to bake my own cinnamon rolls, that’s how enchanted I was with this story, town and characters. I want to live in this cozy fall town and walk into Legends and Lattes every day for my morning coffee and pastry.<br /><br />I gobbled this book up faster than one of Thimble’s cinnamon rolls, and I will be shocked if this doesn’t make it onto my list of best books of the year."

I enjoyed arriving in the town of Thune and getting to know the citizens, together with Viv the Orc. Cal the Hob and Thimble the Ratkin are my favorite characters in the book.<br /><br />You sense a but here, right? There are two of them actually. <br /><br />But, number one: There is so much background information missing. There is too much left out, too many threads left loose, for me to feel fully satisfied after finishing the book. I don't know if it was intentionally held back to be told in an upcoming sequel, or if the author is so immersed in his own creation that he forgets that the reader is new to this world.<br /><br />But, number two: Why do authors of cozy fantasy persist in forcing romance between characters that have no chemistry whatsoever? It's like reading about siblings falling in love. It's cringy and gross and it just ruins that cozy feeling for me. Just let them be friends! Friendships usually last longer than love relationships, anyway."

Reading legends and lattes felt like my mind was huddled up in a warm blanket my grandma crocheted, with a hot cup of tea and a warm plate of cookies beside me. The passages about Thimble and the baked goods they created was my favorite part of the book! It made me want to try baking chocolate filled croissants and cinnamon rolls myself. The only part of this book I didn’t understand (which may be due to personal preference as well) was the budding romance towards the end of the book. It was light and not focused on too much but, I really loved the central theme of friendship this novel has and hoped that it would stick to friendship. Not that love cannot bud from friendship, because it can and often does. But, this almost felt forced to me like OF COURSE the two main characters in a book end up together. How could they not? Nevertheless, looking forward to reading more from this author :)"

This Slice-of-life Cozy Fantasy kept me turning page after page, reading the joy on every page. <br />\tViv the Orc is tired of being a bounty hunter and is hanging up her sword (Figuratively, and literally, as Blackblood is proudly displayed in the shop). She comes to the city of Thune looking to start over again, open her coffee shop, and live a life fulfilled. I love how she finds people with whom she is able to create strong and meaningful friendships with, as well as working relationships. Stories about Women loving Women don't often have them have a happy ending as a couple, and even as Viv and Tandri met it was clear about their attraction to each other. The romance wasn’t overstated, or made to be a big deal, it was just a deepening of their friendship and all the characters accepted that. <br />\tThe ‘Found Family” that Viv manages to cultivate around her, from Tandri, the succubus she takes on as an assistant and becomes her accidental business partner and girlfriend, to her eccentric neighbor, Laney, who while not understanding the coffee world, is still very supportive, to the ever quiet but always easily excitable Ratkin baker, Thimble, and even The Madrigal, the notorious local protection racket, which becomes one of Viv’s benefactors and best customers. The entire ensemble makes for a great cast of characters to be the foreground of this genre bending fantasy. \t"

Although the romantic relationship is not as prominent in the story as the friendships are, these two had me making tea kettle noises all the time. Cuteness overload, indeed.<br /><br />🤗 The friendships. I aspire to have a group of friends as helpful and loyal as the MC has.<br /><br />💔 I did not enjoy:<br /><br />😑 Inconsistencies. I should say they are very, very few, and trust me, I wished I could turn off the part of my brain that notices. But I can't. Even when I love a book as much as I ❤️ this one.<br /><br />🤔 The way the author chose to resolve a conflict that was hyped pretty much since the beginning. It was a little bit anticlimactic."

Still love thimble though. <br /><br />Really enjoyed this book!!<br /><br />A cute, cozy fantasy with an absolutely lovable cast of characters. Thimble was my favorite :) I’ve finished it inspired to do some baking.<br /><br />I like the idea of low stakes stories, and I think the author did a great job making it interesting but slow paced at the same time.<br />And as a coffee loving former barista it really struck him with me!<br />I liked how the characters they didn’t get along with at the start became companions (Hem, the Madrigal) because I’m always a sucker for that. <br /><br /><br />Things that could’ve been better:<br /><br />Pacing is always my biggest issue with stories. Felt like the whole thing happened in a week, and I think the time could have been stretched out more. <br /><br />I also didn’t think the romance was very well done. I think the two characters are cute, but it felt like they went from friends to lovers really abruptly. The relationship felt mostly platonic to me. I would have preferred some more romantic build up throughout the whole story.<br /><br />All in all though it was a great read :)"

      "review": "I wish I could inhabit this book forever. <i>Legends &amp; Lattes</i> is the comfort read version of drinking warm coffee on a long winter night. Such a beautiful, big-hearted story, one that foregrounds deep meaningful friendships and queer love between women as something that heals, something to take up against the times like a sword and shield. I have such a reverent spot in my heart for the kind of fantasy that isn’t about big extravagant conflicts, but which focuses instead on the quiet, tiny, daily moments between people just trying to eke out a decent life, capturing all the safe and easy intimacies of being in proximity of each other, of caring and being profoundly cared for, of making someplace to belong. <i>Legends &amp; Lattes</i> does exactly that. <strong></strong><br /><br />In short, I know the vibes are calamitously bad everywhere in the world right now, and I’m here to say, sincerely and without reservation, that if you are in need of someplace to rest, something cozy and comforting to disappear into, this story—about a butch orc who quits her mercenary job, opens a coffee shop, and finds fierce friendship, community and (sapphic!) love in the process—is for you."

Like, sometimes you just want to get invested in something low-stake but with great, interesting characters and a sweet sapphic romance (and also a big dire-cat), and this was exactly that.<br /><br />Watching Viv make a life for herself from scratch in a new town, finally choosing a place to stay after years of adventuring was honestly so rewarding. The connections she made were so interesting and I like how each character was so vivid and unique, it made me want to learn more about them from the first time I saw them. And I was so invested in the actual process of Viv making a clientele from nothing, and slowly enriching her menu to cater to different needs/tastes (it also made me really hungry).<br /><br />If the concept of cozy fantasy ever appealed to you I really can't recommend this enough. You'll know when it's best for you to read it, whether it's a rainy day or a long day of travelling, but I truly believe anyone can read this and love it."

      "review": "Legends &amp; Lattes: ★★★★✮ | 4.5 stars<br /><br />Is cozy fantasy a genre? If it is, this book would absolutely qualify. And, I need many, many more books like this. <br /><br />Viv is an orc who is tired of battle, and just wants a place to call home. So after her last fight where she procures a fabled artifact, she settles in the city of Thune and attempts to open her very own coffee shop. No one in Thune has ever heard of coffee, and Viv has no idea how to run a café. But, she's got a strong work ethic, and most importantly: hope. She's joined by a succubus, a rattkin, a hob, and even a gnome and a very dangerous kitty cat as she makes her dream a reality.<br /><br />Unfortunately, she's not able to leave her past completely behind her when her former companion tries to collect what he thinks he's owed.<br /><br />This was an utterly delightful high fantasy story all about finding your place in the world. It's got immaculate found family vibes, loads of yummy foods, and is just a joy to read from start to finish. Every single one of these characters are just lovely. And, I want to spend many afternoons in their coffee shop eating Thimble's delicious cinnamon rolls and enjoying a freshly brewed latte.<br /><br />Literally the only \"complaint\" I have is that I would have liked to see a little more of the romance/emotional bond develop between Liv and Tandri. There are the beginnings of a super sweet sapphic romance between the two of them built on a foundation of friendship, I just wanted a little more.<br /><br />Three Thoughts:<br />1. It's a testament to the quality of the book and the writing when you can't even pick a favorite character. I adore them all. <br />2. I kinda wanted to punch Lack for the first half of the book, but when he took Kellin to task? *chef's kiss*<br />3. I need to know more about Durias. He knows way more than he's telling, and I need to know it too.<br /><br />This book is like a warm hug, and I can't recommend it enough. (Also, if the author wanted to write a dozen more books like this I wouldn't be mad about it. Maybe about a bookstore? *fingers crossed*)<br /><br /><i>content warnings: violence, fire, fire injury, harassment, stalking</i>"

Firstly, I need to thank an Amazing Friend for the Recommendation; Her suggestions are always books that hit the spot for me and encourage me to try new books that push me a little and I end up just falling in love with them, this one is no Different. If you are looking for a cosy sapphic fantasy book, then give this one a chance! <br /><br />Legends &amp; Lattes follows an orc named Viv who decides her days of fighting are over and wants to start her own café after the gnomish fashion. No one in town even knows about coffee, so it'll take a lot of effort—and a lot of help—to get her business up and running. She relies on the legendary Scalvert's Stone for luck, but would it be enough to help her start her life afresh?<br /><br />The Vibes from this book are second to none, from the descriptions of the pastries, the relationships created throughout the book, The found family It's such a perfect book. And it's one of my favourite books of 2023 (So Far!). <br /><br />The writing in this book is beautiful. The way the author describes the food, the tastes and smells, and the atmosphere of the cafe... It made it feel like I was there, alongside Viv and Tandri, in a little booth, sipping a latte. I wish I could teleport to their world, and experience how magical this place really is. I found that the author wrote their characters in a way that was very much in detail, making you grow extremely fond of every single one.<br /><br />\"It was like drinking the feeling of being peaceful. Being peaceful in your mind. Well, not if you have too much, then it’s something else.\"<br /><br />If you need a good comfort read that is cosy and feel-good, I cannot recommend this enough!"

Why is cozy-slife-of-life fantasy not an official sub-genre? <br /><br /><blockquote>“Well, shit. Milky bean water. I’ll be damned.” He took another, longer sip and burned his tongue. </blockquote><br /><br />The summary and reviews of this book describe it to a T—low-stakes, cozy adult fantasy. The narrative exists in an extensive fantasy world with elves, dwarves, gnomes, etc.; but the story itself isn’t any crazy “I must save the entire world” situation. Quite the opposite—<b>Viv is tired of adventuring. She wants to settle down and start a warm, homey cafe. </b><br /><br /><i>Legends and Lattes</i> exudes autumn “sweater-weather plus a hot mug of coffee” vibes. From the tavern-esque cafe to the heavenly descriptions of baked goods, it’s the perfect fall read. I imagine myself bundled in blankets on a rainy night with a warm candle nearby, reading this book as I sip on some warm tea…<br /><br />But I digress. Back to the proper (ish) review.<br /><br />This story sort of feels like a video game to me. You know those games where you set up a shop and earn money to continue expanding? This is literally that in book form. Viv starts with nothing, and invites more and more people into her circle as she goes from constructing the cafe to writing up a menu, marketing, adding baked treats, more and more. It was surprisingly nostalgic and brought me back to Dragon City and Pet Shop Story (oop!). But genuinely, I feel a need to revisit those games now, plus maybe try Stardew Valley??<br /><br /><blockquote>“A part of her understood that she was hurting them, wounding these people who were friends. That some older, crueler self was emerging, crawling from the wreckage of who she thought she had become.”</blockquote><br /><br />Although it’s low-stakes, <i>Legends and Lattes</i> still has a fast, fun plot with some very flawed and very real characters. The entire cast was so wholesome and their dynamics were so relatable. The author doesn’t skimp on character development, but it isn’t something that has dedicated significance to solving a great problem, and I prefer it that way. <b>Instead, all those little aspects of living are incorporated seamlessly, giving the story a comfortable feel. </b>There’s also a sweet dash of sapphic romance!<br /><br />I really would recommend Legends and Lattes to anyone looking for a cozy fall read. It’s simple yet absolutely charming, with the best vibes a fantasy reader could ask for. Read it! Please! You’ll thank me later.<br /><br />~~<br /><br />pre-review:<br />i completely devoured this in one fat sitting and am now behind on homework and in severe need of a chocolate croissant. damn you author."

But, sadly, it's not? It seems like a more traditional fantasy author found out about cozy romances and set it in D&amp;D (no shade on D&amp;D! I play) to appeal to their preexisting audience. On the one hand, great! Love that more people will think about and seek out cozy fantasy romances and their authors. On the other hand, this absolutely does not live up to the hype.

      "review": "A silly, light read that felt kinda like watching an HGTV-inspired cosplay webseries. Endless descriptions of finding carpenters and lumber, bakers and cinnamon-- all fine for unwinding on a chilly rainy night after a long, hard day, but not something I'm likely to go back to as, like, a story. Characters are colorful and plentiful, but all pretty one-note, so the book has that bustling coffee shop vibe the author intended, but it's the hollow bustle of a video game with NPCs that just repeat the same few lines every time you bump against them.<br />It feels consistent with the whole tone of the book that at the very end, someone lets Viv know that the monster she killed in the opening scene is actually endangered-- and I don't feel like this is a plot spoiler, because it affects literally no-one, not even Viv, who is basically like, \"Huh, weird.\" And that's it! I felt like every single character was basically waving a big flag that read \"Don't worry, none of this real or has any relation to real-world problems that anyone actually feels bad about like actual racism or actual species extinction or actual sexual harrassment. Everything is fine and we will all reset when you turn off the game!\" Which, I dunno, I feel like even a fluffy, \"low-stakes\" book can still have some actual depth, right? Am I just asking for too much?<br /><br />A final, semi-spoiler note: <input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"spoiler__control\" aria-label=\"The following text has been marked spoiler. Toggle checkbox to reveal or hide.\" onchange=\"this.labels[0].setAttribute('aria-hidden', !this.checked);\" id=\"473459f8-def0-4825-bb6f-b5a3a32c23e5\" /><label aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"spoiler\" for=\"473459f8-def0-4825-bb6f-b5a3a32c23e5\">if you've read the reviews and got excited by the mention of a sapphic romance plotline? Don't. It felt as if it was half-heartedly added last-minute by the author as a favor to a beta-reader who (rightfully!) thought the 2 characters should get together. Honestly, I was insulted, because I felt the characters deserved better than one dry kiss and a bunch of hand-wavy, vague, flowery language about a \"potent dialect of emotions\". It was just so awkward and uncomfortable and very \"I mean, what do lesbians even DO???\", which is a vibe that I would happily leave back in the 90s where it belongs. Blech. I'm tempted to take a whole other star off my rating based on how mad I am about this alone, but given how tiny a portion of the overall book it is, I dunno, maybe that isn't fair? Eff it, I'm mad, let the goodreads police come after me! 2 stars it is, because I paid good money for this book and then still had to go on AO3 after finishing it to try n find some decent orc femslash!</label>"

      "review": "I just had to know what all the excitement was about. It's... fine?<br /><br />Thing number one: I don't like coffee. I found it very silly that everyone was flipping out about it so much, closing their eyes to savor it, in love from the first sip. Same reaction, every single character.<br /><br />I had also heard this was a huge lesbian romance. It... is approximately sapphic. The romance subplot is very slow, unspoken, and doesn't go very far. Which is fine! Great, even. But weird that they're pretty much literally \"really good friends,\" yet people are talking about this like Sappho herself took a break from 69ing Willa Cather in Heaven to come down &amp; bless it. I just thought it'd be much gayer.<br /><br />Third thing I've heard about this is that it's a prime example of the found family trope. And I see it! I'd extend that to say this is more precisely about community because some of the \"family\" members are more well-defined than others. But seeing the community come together was heartening! I loved that!<br /><br />The downside to any story about a character who's leaving a life of adventure behind for a chance at mundanity is, we know they've done much more fun and interesting stuff but we don't get to see it. We have to experience the \"boring\" part. The bonus short story being set pre-cafe with her adventuring buddies seems to admit it too.<br /><br />I think the addition of a character who seems to literally be the author's avatar who explains everything at the end is a bit much. You didn't have to Deus our Machinas like that.<br />5/10<br />#WhatsKenyaReading"

As someone who loves D&amp;D stories, it was nice to read a story following a female orc main character. Not many people write stories with non human main characters these days I feel like who are as likable as Viv. <br />It was basically just a coffee shop upgrade every chapter though. That was the main part of the story, and the serious plot that was given I wish there was more of. The ending just felt very rushed and it didn’t dive as deep as it could have. I honestly think the ending wasn’t as satisfying as it could have been because the author wanted to keep it light. I can respect that, but I also agree with everyone else when they say they just wanted a little bit more substance to the plot. Also the sapphic ship could have been way more prominent. It felt like an add on just for representation. It should have been a bigger part of the story, in my opinion. <br />I would totally be interested in reading the prequel book that just came out! I hear it has more action, and I did enjoy the bonus story at the end. This was the perfect time of the year to read this, and I’m glad I picked it up to see what the hype was all about. "

It felt like a lovely respite from the normal fantasy expectations and all I wanted to do while reading it was to curl up some place cozy (preferably with bad weather), sip some hot coffee, and nibble on a cinnamon roll, and enjoy. <br /><br />This book is advertised as high fantasy, low stakes. And while it’s definitely lower stakes than your typical high fantasy novel, this book is by no means plotless, slow, or without that page-turning appeal. I found myself flying through this book, consistently wanting to know what would happen next and wondering how the characters were going to deal with certain problems or what their next steps would be. <br /><br />This is an incredibly comfy, cozy high fantasy with D&amp;D and Pratchett vibes. It’s cute. It’s interesting. The lesbian/sapphic romance is well done and adorable. <br />I loved every single character. From the MC to the side characters to the rarely seen background characters; they all felt well developed and interesting in their own right. <br /><br />The plot itself is well paced and compelling. I enjoyed the simplicity of it while still finding it interesting. It was very easy to become invested in every aspect of this story. <br /><br />I even loved how the author was able to take things that would normally be considered mundane - like making coffee or biscotti or guitar music - and make it interesting and novel in the fantasy setting.<br /><br />Definitely a favorite read for this year so far.

My favorite character was probably the baker, who is a rat person and barely speaks, named thimble. Love that. My main qualm is the suspension of disbelief that everyone in this universe who tries coffee for the first time loves it. I think of coffee as an acquired taste, and have not acquired it.

Did you know that lattes are named after the gnome who invented it, Latte Diameter?)<br /><br /><br />And Viv goes through the whole thing of, finding a nice town to settle down in, finding a good spot, finding the guy who owns the building, buying it off him, finding a woodworker to help her, designing the interior <br /><br />And like the woodworker, Cal, is like, Bean Water????<br />I mean, that's kinda weird, but like you do you I guess <br /><br />And then he tries a cup of coffee, and is like <br /><i>Oh</i><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />And this book goes through the whole thing of starting up a business, making a menu, hiring the staff<br /><br /><br /><br />It was lovely and cozy as hell. <br />It was fantasy, and I definitely had to look up what some of the creatures were (knob, rattkin, stone elf) <br /><br />But it was so nice. <br />The characters are charming, the story is kind.<br />And like yeah, we're not off saving the world, but like<br />There are still a few stakes. <br /><br />Mostly we're just hanging out and having a good time tho.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />And it was delightful.<br /><br /><br />Everyone in this book drinks coffee like all time, and they enjoy it <br /><br />Characters will sit at a table, and take small sips, and savor the whole cup. <br /><br />And they'll talk about notes of nuts and fruit, and the coffee maker has a grinder, and it's a meditative process to make yourself a cup of coffee in the morning.<br /><br /><br /><br />And like, I've been trying to cut back on coffee a little bit, but like every time i opened this book, they talked about how great coffee is, and it made me want to go to one of my favorite coffee shops and order a nice latte<br /><br /><br />And you know<br />Guys<br />Honestly<br />Like for real<br /><br /><br />I love coffee. I really do. Things are still weird for me at home, and I don't make myself coffee at home<br />(I'm trying to work on it)<br />But I love going to coffee shops. I like having variety, I love that every coffee shop has a different vibe and different tastes. I love that at Stereoscope, the vanilla latte tastes a little different every time, but nonetheless it's always amazing <br /><br />If I'm not doing anything at home, I like having a reason to go out.<br />After years of experimenting I have found I like lattes the most <br /><br /><br />I'm still trying to figure out my identity, even with coffee<br />I would love to have a latte whenever I want, but I also don't want to get a headache if I decide not to have one.<br />Also nice coffee shops are expensive, and I'm not making enough money to justify getting a nice latte 3 times a week 😅😢<br /><br /><br />But just like it's nice to read queer books to feel more comfortable with the Gay Thing <br /><br />It's also super nice to read a book where everyone loves coffee<br />No one is ever shamed for it, and addiction is never mentioned <br /><br />😭<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Anyway, going back to actually talking about the book<br /><br /><br />I loved it. <br /><br />Viv was a badass, and it made me sad whenever she would try to make herself smaller or less scary looking. <br />She's smart, but there are also a few times when she's not very eloquent or plans ahead.<br /><br /><br />Cal was great, very reliable and he had a good heart.<br /><br /><br /><br />Tandri was also great. She's very put together, and she related a lot to Viv in terms of trying to hide herself a bit, what with being a succubus and all.<br /><br /><br />I would die for Thimble, he was such a sweetheart, give him the biggest kitchen you can, he was such a cutie, he was my favorite character.<br /><br /><br />I also super loved Pendry. Poor guy has had it rough, but it was so heartwarming to see him keep trying and to not give up, despite his anxiety and like, not having his dad believe in him<br />(Also like, he's super muscular and has a nice voice, I'd definitely be one of his fans)<br />(Also my boy out here playing electric guitar?? Nice)<br /><br /><br />This book was amazing, and I like fantasy, and the pacing was chill. This book is like drinking a nice Latte from one of your favorite coffee shops after not having had coffee for 3+ days. (It's comforting and rewarding, and soothing, and nice)<br /><br /><br />I'm also adding this to the list of books where literally you can just write whatever you want. <br /><br />In terms of coffee, goddamit, it's nothing to be ashamed of, and like my therapist once told me, the part of me that chooses to drink coffee anyway is very healthy<br /><br /><br /><br />☕"

      "review": "Ok so I first saw this book when we got it in the bookshop I work at. I'm someone who judge a book by its cover.<br /><br />And its title.<br /><br />And its summary.<br /><br />And what can I say? The illustration is gorgeous, the title is catching and the summary was well written. I have kind of a hard time finding fantasy-romances I like. Often, the fantasy is pushed to the background and barely there in favor of the romance and sexual tension, more often than not using the same tropes and characters archetypes.<br /><br />But this one? It was all fantasy. Viv is so pretty on the cover. A buff woman? You already gets many point with me with that. But it's also queer? And there's no unnecessary sex scenes? Let's go!<br /><br />I read it throught. Then once again. Then I forgot to type a review and now that the second is here, well, here I am.<br /><br />The writing is easy to read. Since english isn't my first language, it's nice to sometimes read more \"easy\" books. One where it's just relax. And this one was all I was hoping for. I was also pleasantry surprised by how some of the aspects and tropes were used in the story.<br /><br />All in all, I highly recommend this book. We also got the french version where I work and I was happy, since it meant I couls recommend it to even more people!"
